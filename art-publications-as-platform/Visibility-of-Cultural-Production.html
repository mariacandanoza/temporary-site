<br><br>
Visibility of Cultural Production

<br><br>
Another extreme in dealing with the public sphere is executed by artistic
projects that draw on a larger, anonymous public in principle but which
consciously refuse to be a part of the established distribution systems and
thereby demonstrate en passant the thin border that separates publishing
from "random communication and chance encountering." When
Lucas W. Melkane, for instance, leaves copies of his book in a backpack
in public spaces as a symbol of protest to the contemporary culture of
the market and spectacle and allows it to be found by chance like a message
in a bottle, he simulates a thought experiment that is often employed in
scholarly discussions in their attempts to define the public sphere in connection
with publishing:

<br><br>
"Here's a brief thought experiment: you write a novel, and leave it on
a park bench. Is this a published novel? Let's say you print 1,000 copies,
leaving them on 1,000 park benches. How about now? Or how about
a publisher buys it, takes out masses of adverts, but literally no one buys
a single copy? In what sense has that work been published? At what
point does a letter or email pass from private correspondence to public,
published text? One hundred or 100,000 recipients? Or is the idea
of putting a numerical value on being public absurd, and if so, what
conceptual distinction should we make instead? IfI post the email on the
Internet, we can assume it has been published, but then, if nobody views
it, how is it more public than an email sent to 100 people?"

<br><br>
Questions such as these gain particular relevance in light of the new digital
forms of production and communication. Melkane 's abandoned backpack
and the message in a bottle set out at sea that is familiar from previous centuries are in a certain sense analogous to today's posting, blogging or
tweeting-all of which have rekindled the discussion about the public nature
of publishing.

<br><br>
Furthermore, Lucas W. Melkane's subversive form of undercover
distribution contains a high-level of presuppositions in that he is infringing
upon the "unwritten etiquette" of this artistic "practice known as 'shop.
dropping,"' namely "that the goods in question should clearly and explicitly
be works of art. " As it happens, Lucas W. Melkane 's book is a reprint
of Alain Robbe-Grillet's novel Jealousy whose story Melkane has supplemented
with two details-nevertheless, without indicating them and without
listing himself as the author of the reprint. Even if one holds the opinion that
the books Melkane placed in the world are published and distributed,
they are rarely understood as being "his" work by others. If anything, the
publications are circulating under the wrong name. Eva Weinmayr reports
of a similar case in her contribution, where an unknown person added
two chapters to a pirate copy of a Jaime Bayly's novel without making any
indication of it. Following Lucas W. Melkane, one could also speak of
an "artwork that exists within indifference" in this case; an artwork whose
author never reveals his/her identity. Such a work ventures not only to
withdraw its distribution from established channels but also to rid itself of
the typical distinctions drawn in our culture that are, for instance, connected
with the author's function.

<br><br>
The staging of withdrawal is also an apt description of Katie Paterson's
Future Library (2014), which Paul Benzon discusses in his contribution.
Placing full trust in the future, Paterson planted a forest in 2014 and founded
a library for texts that will be submitted yearly by famous authors. These
literary texts, however, will only be published on the paper from the trees
and presented to the public in 2114. In this constellation of delay that offers
neither amplification, distribution nor access, the texts inevitably "remain
in a limbo of potentiality." This leads Paul Benzon to speak of "a corpus
of unpublished works of fiction" and to pose the question whether Margaret
Atwood, who submitted the first text, can already list it in her catalog of works.

<br><br>
The long time frame and uncertainty of the outcome of Katie
Paterson's project call attention to the enormous effort that the artist has
invested to ensure the longevity of the texts in a secured space: the setting
includes a special library room, an archival and library-oriented infrastructure,
financial safeguarding (through selling limited editions), city and
state funding (the disposal and protection of a piece of forest as well as
a library space), as well as private, non-profit engagement (selection panel
and committee of trustees). This case seems to also affirm Kenneth
Goldsmith's pointer, which Annette Gilbert discusses in connection with
institutional critical publishing projects, that "you have the institution as
survival strategy."

<br><br>
There are other publishing projects that take a contrary position and
consciously withdraw from the established practices of institutionally disseminating, registering, archiving, and protecting publications. The NO-ISBN movement that Bernhard Cella discusses in the present volume
is an example of such "strategies of decentralization and disobedience."
For a variety of reasons, this movement refrains from providing its publications
to institutions and the market. As a consequence, it more or less
consciously takes the risk of remaining "invisible." This means that they are
scarcely ever registered in libraries or archives and are often fated to become
invisible or lost, ending much like the so-called gray literature. What
is meant here by invisibility is very different than what is meant in Elisabeth
Tonnard's The Invisible Book: It is of an institutional nature and not of a
material one.

<br><br>
Kenneth Goldsmith makes a provocative reversal to what has already
been suggested in his If lt Doesn't Exist on the Internet, It Doesn't Exist where
he links the public sphere today with words posted in the Internet and not with
those that are printed and institutionally supported:

<br><br>
"the new radicalism is paper. Right. Publish it on a printed page and no
one will ever know about it. It's the perfect vehicle for terrorists,
plagiarists, and for subversive thoughts in general. [ ... ] if you don't want
it to exist-and there are many reasons to want to keep things private keep
it off the web."

<br><br>
Whether this is the case is up for debate. Nevertheless, the current discourse
demonstrates that there are numerous concepts of the public sphere at play
here and that an ironclad drawing of fronts between the Internet and print
distorts the richness of the constellations of the mediums. Instead of simply
counteracting the public sphere of the printed word with that of the posted,
it seems more productive to concentrate on mixed forms-like, for instance,
experimental post-digital literature that, as Hannes Bajohr suggests,
profit from "the strange status of POD as at once analog and digital" and to
assume that there is a range of visibility in both media forms. This is because,
as shown, there is a scale of visibility that can be found within a single realm
itself (see the example of "visible" institutionally secured publications
and mostly "invisible" NO-ISBN publications). Likewise, as Hannes Bajohr
maintains, not every speech act in the Internet has the same status of being
"public." Even in the Internet, "existence" in the public sphere depends
on a number of constellations, such as the "site" of the "publication" (i.e.
there is a difference between private homepages, curated sites and highly ranked
platforms) and the reputation of the speaker: on the Internet
"the perlocutionary part of a speech act (and the publishing gesture is one)
depends in its outcome on the identity and the status of the agent performing
it: It makes a difference who publishes what in which context."

<br><br>
Regardless of how this question is decided, we can nevertheless
maintain that if we want to ensure that this form of prolific cultural production
that originates outside of established institutions-ignoring here
questions concerning the number of copies and whether the publication is
digital or in print-will be publicly perceived and enter the cultural memory, then alternative ways of labeling, acquiring, assigning value, tracing, and
archiving must be discovered-just as Alessandro Ludovico urges
in his contribution: "People involved should then assume responsibility in
scanning and sharing, on a personal and independent level, to build their
own cultural history, preserving (physically) and sharing (digitally) all
the knowledge that they think is valuable." This can be achieved in the form
of a database, such as NO-ISBN, samizdat and Internet archives, like
MANI and aaaaarg.fail, formerly aaaaarg.org, or in social library projects
like BookCrossing and memoryoftheworld.org-all of which are projects
that Bernhard Cella, Valentina Parisi, Alessandro Ludovico, and Eva
Weinmayr present in their contributions. The social components of these
self-organized initiatives shouldn't be underestimated. They often arise
out of the desire to share and exchange and serve as a platform for an activist
community. According to Eva Weinmayr in her contribution with the telling
title "Library Underground-A Reading List for a Coming Community,"
such projects follow in the footsteps of the librarian activists of the 1970s
and have aspirations to develop alternative systems of classification and cataloging.

<br><br>
But we are not only concerned with whether or not these publications
that exist outside of the institution can be located and archived. The question
of assigning value to them is also closely related. By circumventing
the established publishing houses and institutions, they lack authority in the
public sphere. It is as if they didn't exist. One can already ascertain from
the blanket derogatory designation of self-publishing ventures as "vanity
presses" that they are not sufficiently appreciated. As such, they must establish
their right to existence and cultural value through other means. Ifit
was previously true that in the established gatekeeper system "[e]ven a book
that sold poorly and received no or terrible reviews was considered 'legitimate'
because someone outside of the author saw value in it," then publications
stemming from outside an institution must face the reality that they
"don't count. New Institutions, not gatekeepers, but alternative groups that
take [this kind of] writing [and publishing] seriously will be needed to
validate this form of cultural production." The coming years will show
whether this will succeed.
