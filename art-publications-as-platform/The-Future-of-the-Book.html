The Future of the Book

<br><br>
Every artistic innovation is unique, it has no development. In time different variations on the same theme grow up around innovation, maybe higher, maybe lower, but they will rarely reach the original power of the first. This goes on until long familiarity has made the effect of the work of art so automatic that the senses no longer react to the worn means and the time is ripe for a further technical innovation. However, the "technical" and the "artistic" (so-called) are inseparable, so we must not lightly dispose of a profound relationship by means of a few slogans. At any rate, the first few books printed by Gutenberg with the system of movable type which he invented remain the finest examples of the art of book production.

<br><br>
The next few hundred years saw no basic innovations (until photography) in this field. In typography there are just more or less successful variations accompanying technical improvements in the manufacturing apparatus. The same happened with a second discovery in the visual field with photography. As soon as we give up assuming a complacent superiority over everything else, we must admit that the first Daguerro-types are not primitive artifacts needing improvements, but the finest photographic art. It is shortsighted to suppose that machines, i.e., the displacement of manual by mechanical processes, are basic to the development of the form and figure of an artifact. In the first place, the consumer's demand determines the development, i.e., the demand of the social strata that provide the "commissions." Today this is not a narrow circle, a thin cream, but "everybody;' the masses. The idea moving the masses today is called materialism, but dematerialization is the characteristic of the epoch. For example, correspondence grows, so the number of letters, the quantity of writing paper, the mass of material consumed expand, until relieved by the telephone. Again, the network and material of supply grow until they are relieved by the radio. Matter diminishes, we dematerialize, sluggish masses of matter are replaced by liberated energy. This is the mark of our epoch.

<br><br>
What conclusions does this imply in our field?

<br><br>
I draw the following analogy:
Inventions in the field
of verbal traffic
Inventions in the field
of general traffic
<br>
<br>Articulated language .................Upright gait
<br>Writing ........................................The wheel
<br>Gutenberg's printing-press ...... Carts drawn by animal power
<br>? •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• The automobile
<br>? .......................................... The airplane

<br><br>
I have produced this analogy to prove that so long as the
book remains a palpable object, i.e., so long as it is not
replaced by auto-vocalizing and kino-vocalizing representations,
we must look to the field of the manufacture of books
for new basic innovations in the near future, so that the general
level of the epoch can be reached in this field.

<br><br>
There are signs to hand suggesting that this basic innovation
is likely to come from the neighborhood of the collotype.
Here we have a machine which captures the subject
matter on a film and a press which copies the negative of the
material on to sensitive paper. Thus the frightful weight of
the subject matter and the bucket of dye is omitted, so that
once again we have dematerialization. The most important
thing here is that the mode of production of words and pictures
is included in the same process: photography. Up till
now photography is that mode of expression which is most
comprehensible. We have before us the prospect of a book
in which exposition has priority over letters.

<br><br>
We know of two kinds of writing: one sign for each concept-
hieroglyphic (modern Chinese); and one sign for
each sound-alphabetic. The progress of the alphabetic
over the hieroglyphic mode is only relative. Hieroglyphics
are international. This means that if a Russian, a German,
or an American fixes the sign (picture) of a concept in his
mind he can read Chinese or Egyptian (soundlessly), without
learning the language, for language and writing are
always one creation as far as he is concerned.

<br><br>
We may conclude that:
1 the hieroglyphic book is international (at
least potentially)
2 the alphabetic book is national, and
3 the book of the future will be non-national;
for it needs the least education to understand it.

<br><br>
There are today two dimensions to the word. As sound it is
a function of time; as exposition, of space. The book of the
future must be both. This is how to overcome the automatism
of the contemporary book. A world-view which has
become automatic ceases to exist in our senses, so we are
left drowning in a void. The dynamic achievement of ar! is
to transform the void into space, i.e., into a unity conceivable
for our senses.

<br><br>
An alteration in the structure and mode of language
implies a change in the usual appearance of the book. Before
the War, printed matter in Europe was appropriately enough
converging in appearance in every country. A new optimistic
mentality laying stress on immediate events and the
fleeting moment underlay the origins in America of a new
form of printing. They began to modify the relation of word
and illustration in exposition into the direct opposite of the European style. The highly developed technique of facsimi -
le-electrotype (half-tone blocks) was especially important
for this development; thus photomontage was born.

<br><br>
After the War, skeptical and stunned Europe marshaled
a screaming, burning language: all means must be used to
maintain and assert oneself. The catchwords of the epoch
were "attraction" and "trick." The new appearance of the
book was characterized by:

<br><br>
1 broken-up setting 2 photomontage and typomontage

<br><br>
These facts , which are the basis for our predictions, were
already foreshadowed before the War and our Revolution.
Marinetti, the siren of Futurism, also dealt with typography
in his masterly manifestos. In 1909 he wrote:

<br><br>
The book will be the futurist expression of our futurist
consciousness. I am against what is known as the harmony
of a setting. When necessary we will use three or
four colours to a page, and 20 different typefaces. E.g. we
shall represent a series of uniform, hasty perceptions with
cursive, a scream will be expressed in bold type and so
on. So a new painterly typographic representation will
be born on the printed page.

<br><br>
Many of today's creations do not go beyond this demand. I
should like to stress that Marinetti does not call for playing
with form as form, but asks rather that the action of a new
content should be intensified by the form.

<br><br>
Before the War the notion of the simultaneous book
was also proposed and, in a sense, realized. This was in the
Poem of Blaise Cendrars, typographically conceived by
Sonia Delaunay-Terk. It is a foldable strip of paper 5 feet
long- an attempt at a new book-form for poetry. The lines
of poetry are printed in color, with colors always discontinued
in the content and changed into others.

<br><br>
In England during the War the Vortex group published
their magazine Blast! in a crude, elementary style, using
almost only unrelieved capitals, a style which has become
the token of all modern international printing.

<br><br>
In Germany, the 1917 Prospectus of the little Neue Jugend
Portfolio is an important document of the new typography.

<br><br>
The new movement which began in Russia in 1908 bound
painter and poet together from the very first day; hardly a
poetry book has appeared since then without the collaboration
of a painter. Poems have been written with the lithographic
crayon and signed. They have been cut in wood.
Poets themselves have set whole pages. Thus the poets
Khlebnikov, Kruchenykh, Maya kovski , Aseev have worked
with the painters Rosanova, Goncharova, Malevich, Popova,
Burlyuk, elc. Tuer did not produce select, numbered, deluxe
cditiom, but cheap unlimited volumes, which today we
must treat as popular art despite their sophistication.

<br><br>
In the Revolutionary period a latent energy has concentrated in the younger generation of our artists, which can only find release in large-scale popular commissions. The audience has become the masses, the semi-literate masses. With our work the Revolution has achieved a colossal labor of propaganda and enlightenment. We ripped up the traditional book into single pages, magnified these a hundred times, printed them in color and stuck them up as posters in the streets. Unlike American posters, ours were not designed for rapid perception from a passing motorcar, but to be read and to enlighten from a short distance. If a series of these posters were today to be set in the size of a manageable book, in an order corresponding to some theme, the result would be most curious. Our lack of printing equipment and the necessity for speed meant that, though the best work was hand-printed, the most rewarding was standardized, lapidary and adapted to the simplest mechanical form of reproduction. Thus State Decrees were printed as rolled-up illustrated leaflets, and Army Orders as illustrated pamphlets.

<br><br>
At the end of the Civil War (1920 ), we had the opportunity to realize our aims in the field of the creation of new books, in spite of the primitiveness of the mechanical means at our disposal. In Vitebsk, we brought out five issues of a magazine called Unovis, printed by typewriter, lithography, etching and linocut.

<br><br>
As I have already written: "Gutenberg's Bible was only printed with letters. But letters alone will not suffice for the handing down of today's Bible. The book finds its way to the brain through the eyes, not through the ears; light waves travel much faster and more intensely than sound waves. But humans can only speak to each other with their mouths, whereas the possibilities of the book are multi-form.”

<br><br>
With the advent of the period of reconstruction in 1922, the production of books also rose rapidly. Our best artists seized on the problem of book production. At the beginning of 1922 I and the writer Ilya Ehrenburg edited the periodical Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet, which was printed in Berlin. Access to the most developed German printing techniques enabled us to realize some of our ideas about the book. Thus we printed a picture-book, The Story oJTwo Squares, which we had finished in our productive period of 1920, and the Mayakovski-Book, which made even the form of the book corresponding to the particular edition a functional structure. At the same time our artists were exploring the technical possibilities of printing. The State Publishing House and other printing establishments put out books which were shown, and appreciated, at several international exhibits in Europe. Comrades Popova, Rodchenko,Klutsis, Stepanova, and Gan devoted themselves to book design. Some worked directly in the print shop with the compositors and presses (Gan, et al.). The growing esteem in which book design is held is indicated by the practice of listing on a special page all the names of all the compositors and finishers concerned with the book.  This means that there has grown up in all printshops a stratum of workers who have helped develop a conscious relation to their craft.

<br><br>
Most of the artists produce montages, that is, lay out photographs and suitable captions together on a page which is then made into a block for printing. Thus is conceived a form of undeniable power, apparently very simple to handle and therefore easily diverted into banality, but in skillful hands extremely fruitful as a means to visual poetry.

<br><br>
At the outset we said that the expressive power of each artistic innovation is unique and has no development. The innovation of easel-painting made great works of art possible, but it has now lost this power. The cinema and the illustrated weekly have succeeded it. We rejoice in the new means which technique has put into our hands. We know that a close relation with the actuality of general events, the continuing heightening of the sensitivity of our optic nerves, the record-breaking speed of social development, our, command over plastic material, the reconstruction of the plane and its space, and the simmering force of innovation have enabled us to give the book new power as a work of art.

<br><br>
Of course, today's book has not found a new overall structure, it is still a single volume with a cover, a back and pages 1, 2, 3, . . . The same is true of the theater. Even our most modern drama plays in a theater-like a peepshow, with the public in the stalls, in boxes and in rows in front of the curtain. But the stage has been cleared of all the paraphernalia of painted scenery, the stage-space as a painted perspective has perished. A three-dimensional physical space has been born in the same peepshow, allowing maximal unfolding of the fourth dimension, living movement. Within the book modernism may not yet have gone so far,but we must learn to see the tendency.

<br><br>
Notwithstanding the crisis which book production, like every other area of production, is undergoing, the avalanche of books grows with every passing year. The book is the most monumental art form today; no longer is it fondled by the delicate hands of a bibliophile, but seized by a hundred thousand hands. This illuminates the hegemony of the illustrated weekly in this transition period. We should add to the number of illustrated weeklies the flood of children's picture books. Our children's reading teaches them a new plastic language; they grow up with a different relation to the world and space, to image and color, so they are preparing for a new kind of book. But we shall be satisfied if we can conceptualize the epic and lyric developments of our times in our form of book.
