Notes Toward a Publishing Practice

<br><br>
It is Monday, the 8th of October, 2018, in Berlin.

<br><br>Much of the impulse to publish is the compelling desire to
disseminate stories for the intrinsic subversive potential
they can yield. For the way they create cracks in dominant
narratives. For the way they trigger the formation of alternative
readings, plant the seeds for new understandings.
Much of the publishing impulse comes from the intense
relationship with languages and their potential.

<br><br>Perhaps a pertinent place to start is to approach the many
questions surrounding the very act of "making public."
Questioning is the foundation of the publishing process. It
is also that which forces the continual disengagement from
congealed meaning, from the pitfalls of certainty. It is that
which allows hypotheses to play a constitutive role in shaping
the many ways of thinking the world.

<br><br>
• What does the practice of making public entail?
<br>• What does it mean to make public here and now?
<br>• What are the sources from which the compelling
necessity to make public emerges?
<br>• What are the implications in making public those
concealed, undermined, or forgotten stories?
<br>• How to find, select and edit stories in today's complex
scenario of multiple worlds and temporalities?
<br>• How to nurture the fundamental relationship with
publics?
<br>• How to establish a conscious standpoint?
<br>• How to question the rules of the game?
<br>• How to foster and prioritize polyphony over coded voices?
<br>• How to perpetuate the act of questioning?

<br><br>We could say that establishing terrains, mapping experiences,
and defining the sources and conditions of frameworks
and points of enunciation are the critical first steps
in the foundation of a publishing practice.

<br><br>We could say that a publisher doesn't solely publish books but authors as well. We could hint at the fact that publishing is the creation of an ecosystem where authors, translators, and editors are working to build a line of communication
with different publics. Working toward the
establishment of a bond of mutual trust. We could say that
this ecology would feed learning and exchange, disseminate
meaning beyond itself.

<br><br>We could say that publishing is a collective practice in
which we question the limits of our most certain ways of
knowing, thinking, and doing. The very boundaries of systems
of thought and knowledge production. We could say it
is a space for the exploration of the possibility to think otherwise-
to tirelessly question the order of things. It entails
a crisis of the epistemological framing of our worlds. It is
the product of an active vision, of a gaze which perceives
what is not there, and actualizes it.

<br><br>We could say publishing is a practice in which a critical
approach manifests itself through the willingness to scrutinize
fundamental truths, through not accepting given
structures on the mere basis of authority, and addressing
the violence they uphold. In this capacity, the practice
of publishing entails exposing oneself to existing powers
regardless of the consequences. We could say publishing
is a practice of critical thinking, wherein the term critical
is unbound from any negative connotations and instead
understood as a symptom of crisis, as a mode of radical
inquiry interfering with these existing relations of power
while simultaneously questioning the validity of its own
perspective.

<br><br>We could say that the practice of publishing thrives on
the desire to create moments of sharing, to bring together
readers from across different contexts to explore how we
can transcend national boundaries and discuss models for
sharing and distributing knowledge. We could say that the
practice of publishing should imagine a borderless world
while simultaneously confronting the realities of borders.

<br><br>We could say that mobility is immanent to the form of
the book and as such it requires the engagement with multiple
worlds. We could say that a book is an autonomous
space-time sequence engaging with multiple temporalities.

<br><br>We could say that a book can problematize the myth of linearity,
bear witness to the presence of the past within the
present, and highlight the juxtaposition of temporalities
and of their resistance to categorization.

<br><br>We could say that the practice of publishing should
imagine processes of (un)learning and subjectively constructing
non-hegemonic narratives-in the form of
self-education, auto-didacticism, and self-learning-which
protest and provide exit strategies from the normativity of
education systems.

<br><br>We could say that the practice of publishing is concerned
with the nature and implications of filtering and amplifying
contents, and with the potential of these two processes as
transformative action.

<br><br>We could say that the practice of publishing entails acting
against the impoverishment of information, of meaning.
It is to salvage information from the tissue of established-
often historical-meaning, to loosen the weave
and open it up to new readings and new meanings.

<br><br>We could say that the practice of publishing always, thus,
implodes the present fabric of meaning. The act of publication,
therefore, corresponds to the act of protest, and the
space of publication becomes a space of protest and contestation,
where the possibility to un-weave repressive and
hierarchical histories is (re)awakened.

<br><br>We could say that, within this perspective, publishing
the archive is especially powerful, as it is the product
of an engaged, active gaze which dismantles (temporal)
hierarchies. Thus, publishing the archive involves a literal
unweaving of repressive narratives and, as a consequence,
redefines and reappropriates the archive itself as a tool
which no longer categorizes but is, rather, open to continuous
unfixing, de-archiving, and re-archiving.

<br><br>We could say that publishing is a protest act that recreates
reality, or creates it anew. It is to protest the exclusionary
principle which defines the archive when submitted
to passive investigation. The dynamics of publishing thus
become shaped by forms and means which actively participate
in the erosion of this exclusionary principle.

<br><br>We could say that the practice of publishing should master
strategies of camouflage and coding through the political
potential of the poetical.

<br><br>We could-and should-see the practice of publishing as
an essential site of resistance and protest.
