<br><br>
PUBLICATIONS

<br><br>
Gloria Glitzer understands publications as free and safe spaces in which self-determined political and aesthetic questions are negotiated and social communities are defined through publishing as an artistic practice.
<br><br>
The publications never refer only to themselves, but reflect critically, ironically, sometimes strikingly and sometimes enigmatically on art, society, the feeling, the object, the ego and always great comrades-in-arms from music and art whose work Gloria Glitzer celebrates and wants to say thank you to them with her publications.
