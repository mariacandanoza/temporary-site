 researcher and publisher, textile history bibliographer and collector,
 and a researcher working on a project on time and causality in physics.
At his gallery, Seth Siegelaub Contemporary Art, operating between the
fall of 1964 and April 1966, for one exhibition Siegelaub encouraged
visitors to lounge on couches and chairs to appreciate the show as an
overall environment and hosted a four-day happening featuring the artist
Arni Hendin. He was an aggressive promoter and paid as much attention to
press and publicity as to the content of exhibitions, showing that even
unconventional art work could be sold.<br><br>
After the close of the gallery he gradually became, in Joseph Kosuth's
words, a "curator-at-large". He was the first exhibition organizer to
specialize in dealing with conceptual art, holding group exhibitions that
had no existence outside of the catalogue., and was an active "independent
curator", organizing 21 art exhibitions, books, catalogues and projects,
 throughout the USA, Canada and Europe between February 1968 and July 1971
 in a wide range of new and original formatincluding several important group
 shows, such as

of "The Artist's Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement," published
in 1971, which has been translated and published in French, Italian,
German and Dutch.<br><br>

 in Amsterdam to bring together his varied range of projects: contemporary
