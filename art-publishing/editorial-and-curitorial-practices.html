Editorial and Curatorial Practices

<br><br>
The aforementioned tendency to work with found materials is closely related to the increasing convergence between publishing and curatorial practices, which has been documented as a further trend in the context of publishing as artistic practice by Anna-Sophie Springer and Hanna Kuusela in their contributions. That the "curatorial"ethos" has found its way into the publishing practice should be no surprise since curating has taken over in almost all realms of life (from fashion and collections to magazines and online platforms). Dorothea von Hantelmann speaks of"the curatorial paradigm" that shapes our post-industrial and post-material consumer society: "the skill-or, if you will, the 'art' -of choosing has become a cultural practice in its own right."67 The core of curation is this very art of selecting, which includes its capability of ascribing meaning to the selection.
<br><br>
If the curatorial practice was previously at home in the exhibition business of museums and galleries, and has in the meantime ascended to its own artistic activity in those fields, it can now also be found in "the 'paginated' realm of reproductions-the world of books and libraries." Anna-Sophie Springer demonstrates this kind of"curatorial space" in her contribution about books on birds: "for those asking how publishing and the curatorial relate and intersect, natural history books open up unique pathways beyond art history."
<br><br>
In the literary field one can also discern that an increasing number of agents understand their literary or editorial practice as curatorial and/ or label them as such. In one of his most recent aphorisms, Kenneth Goldsmith thus postulates that "Choice is authorship. Legitimate authorship." This is seconded in the "blurb" to his Theory, which is nqt arbitrarily organized as a loose-leaf collection, where it is stated that it is "curated by the author-poet."
<br><br>
One can take a critical stance to this current fashion. Nevertheless, it is unmistakable that the curatorial practice and the publishing practice, especially the editorial practice, do indeed have a large overlap: processes of selection, organizing, arranging, putting into relationship, and presentation of materials represent the core of curation as well as publishing, i.e. editing. As previously mentioned, Michael Bhaskar also counts filtering as being one of the four basic components of publishing practice and affirms that "curation competencies lie within the ambit of publishing speciality," whereby the very recent influence of curating has set a new tone: "Filtering is slowly shifting from a selection emphasis to a curation emphasis." The difference between them, however, is that curation "is less about commissioning, more about combining; less about origination and binary choice deliberations, more about arrangement and patterning." It could be that the key to the future of publishing lies within the curatorial approach: "Part of why curation is so valuable to the future of publishing is that almost by definition it cannot be totally mechanized. [ ... ] Yet curation isn't just about efficiency; it's also about personal taste, an individual's style and judgment. Curation has value precisely because of its fuzziness, its ability to surprise with a flash of insight."

In contrast to this, Hanna Kuusela takes a critical view on the emergence of curatorial practice in the literary field since it strengthens the culture of (self-)promotion. In their drive for recognition and authorship, the literary curators-in contrast to the traditionally rather withdrawn understanding of a publisher or editor's role-"not only make public others' texts but also seek [visibility and] publicity for their own practices, and thus accumulate and create cultural capital for themselves." This can be seen particularly in the appropriating and participatory forms of literature that are based on the use off oreign texts. Originality is not proclaimed for the published contents but rather for the idea of the project and the collation, frame and presentation of the foreign contents. Hanna Kuusela fears that this profiling of the publisher or editor as a curator threatens to be at the expense of authors whose texts-whether they consent or not-are used in the curator's project: "the praxis of curating is also, or above all, an act of reterritorialization, i.e., an act of designing a new power." This is shown in Nick Thurston's Of the Subcontract, which, according to Hanna Kuusela, critically reveals "how the relationship between the (multiple) producers of the text and the (individual) literary curator" can take on ethically dubious and exploitative traits "when taken to the extreme," but it cannot escape the dilemma that "[p] oets and professors can point to this change, but so far, have not been able to move beyond it."
