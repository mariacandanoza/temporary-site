<br><br>
Interview with Tauba Auerbach<br>
This interview took place over email in April 2021.

<br><br>
MARIA:  So why is the materiality of the book important to you? What is its potential?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  I mean, I guess there are eBooks, but I&#39;m interested in making the books that you can handle. They are
material things. I guess I like both the restriction of, and possibility in binding structures. I&#39;m always
interested in how a thing is connected to itself. …. its inner architecture. So yeah, books are topologically
interesting.
<br>
I also think a lot gets conveyed through touch and books are things that you handle and manipulate.

<br><br>
MARIA:  What significance does it have to you that the books from Diagonal Press are produced by accessible, consumer-level printing and binding processes? Is there an idea of democratizing the art process in this way? I also know you have said you like having a direct relationship with the process of making, do you think this holds any particular importance to the final result? Is it a conceptual conceit or purely a personal preference?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  It's first a personal preference.
<br>Even in my general art practice I try to do as much as possible here in cutty, simple ways. I think I like
doing ambitious things with modest materials, and I like making things, not just designing things.
<br>Do I think any holds any particular importance in the final result? I don’t know. Maybe it makes the
publications feel more personal? Maybe they give people the idea that it’s not so hard to make a book,
and they should self-publish.

<br><br>
MARIA:  As I understand it, one of Diagonal Press major objectives is to take your work out of the art market, and that is why it's important that all the editions are open and unsigned. Can you tell me a little more about why this is important to you?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  No, I guess I should clear that up. It&#39;s not to take it out of the art market. It&#39;s certainly participating in an
art market, but I wanted to remove a secondary market as much as possible. because when I started
diagonal, I was feeling very frustrated with the way my paintings were being treated in the secondary
market and how often younger artists are sort of used in this game or sport of speculation. And part of
the reason I even started the press was because I was feeling grouchy about that. And I felt like I needed
to do something that frustration wasn&#39;t grouchy.
<br>The first year I was at the New York art book fair, people came to my table and asked me to sign
something or they’d ask what the edition size was. And when I explained to them that there were no
edition sizes and nothing would be signed, a lot of people walked away. I was very happy to see those
people go and they don&#39;t really come around that much anymore. So that&#39;s great. You know, I&#39;m just, I&#39;m
not, I&#39;m not getting up in the morning and working for the person who&#39;s buying my poster just to sell it
on eBay the next day. That is not interesting to me or inspiring to me. And it makes me feel a little
exploited when it happens. I&#39;m making things for people who are interested in the things themselves.
And I also wanted it to have a channel of production that was financially accessible to the people that I
consider my desired audience. And increasingly that was not people who could afford my paintings and
sculptures.

<br><br>
MARIA:  Do you view the books published by Diagonal Press as vessels of information or visual content?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  I guess I would just say both, although I&#39;m always just put off by the word content because it feels like
creative agency speak to me now.
<br>
So maybe I’d say they're both vessels of information and they are information.

<br><br>
MARIA:  Have you considered making digital versions of the books that could be available online like The Serving Library operates?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  No, I haven&#39;t considered making digital versions of the books. I don&#39;t think it would be very interesting.
For example, like for the reciprocal score pop-up book or Z helix, I just don&#39;t think these specific books
would translate.

<br><br>
MARIA:  Are the books priced solely on a material basis?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  Mostly, yes, mostly. I'm just trying to make them as affordable as possible, given what they cost me to
make them (not including my time).

<br><br>
MARIA:  Do you have a plan to maintain the open edition aspect of this practice? It seems like it could be hard to maintain down the line as far as labour and maybe materials becoming unavailable, does this also play a role when you decide on the process and materiality of each book or object?

<br><br>
TAUBA: Yeah, you're totally right. It already has been impossible to maintain total sameness. Like they stopped
making the yellow binding tape for one of my books, so that had to change.
<br>To me, what “open” means is not infinite and not necessarily uniform. It means open open-ended and
indeterminate. I reserve the right to change publications and make updates too. Nothing about the
edition is promised or even really disclosed.

<br><br>
MARIA:  Art books have become commodities, other than the open edition aspect of Diagonal Press how do you think you push back against this idea?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  It’s pretty hard to push back on anything being commodified because we're in capitalism and that’s
what it spits out. But I feel like you can have a small business and not have it be motivated by infinite
profit and growth. I like that recently Be Oakley wrote and spoke about this: about choosing to have
their press Genderfail not be a “not-for-profit”, but be as they call it a “profit-for-survival” model of
business, saying they want to make money to support their life and the lives of the artists they're
publishing, but that doesn’t mean being driven by greed or willing to exploit others.
<br><br>
MARIA:  Other than a critique of the art world’s economy, do you see a potential for diagonal press to become a place for political discourse? I like how you have discussed in the past binding as a metaphor. Is this a preoccupation you still have?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  I guess, yes, there is an implied critique of the art world's economy, but I don't
want to dwell on it. I just want to dwell on experimenting with other ways to function while exchanging
art for money that are more autonomous and straightforward. And friendly.
<br>I talked about binding in another question, so I guess it&#39;s clear that yes, it is still a preoccupation of mine,
anything interlocking and interlaced is interesting to me for some reason.
<br>And for your question about political discourse -- I suppose that the maps I published recently have a
political point of view. They're motivated by working to retune my own gaze while looking at this sphere
when it’s flattened. I intend to make more maps. And I can imagine politics creeping in more in the
future.
<br>I also, I suppose it's somewhat political, I don't know if that's the right word really, but related to the
political, to the social. I recently added to my website very long site history for where my studio is. I
started out thinking about composing a land acknowledgement, and I read a lot of different indigenous
viewpoints on them, and it showed me that the most important thing was not to be perfunctory about
it. I got curious not only about the indigenous people but all the other hands this land passed through.
And I ended up working with my assistant to compose a timeline of this and gathered a bunch of old
maps. It's an ongoing project, but a timeline of this plot of land is on the diagonal website since last
year, and also right inside my front door when you come into my studio.

<br><br>
MARIA:  You said in an interview that similar to Dither Roth, your art practice essentially funds Diagonal Press. Have you considered it becoming a platform for other artists? And maybe for collaborations?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  Yeah, unfortunately my art practice essentially funds diagonal press. But, but also
fortunately I have an art practice that can funds diagonal press! I’m grateful for that.
<br>And yes, I've considered it becoming a platform for other artists. Definitely. I want to publish other
people and I even have a written list of people that I would reach out to if/when I do that, but I just am
not finding myself with enough bandwidth. I’m not going to publish anyone else until I know I can do it
right. And that time is not now or really on the very near horizon, to be honest. Plus I have a pretty
major backlog of half-finished publications that I've been working on for a long time. So I would have to
get those out the door first.
So who knows...if diagonal press exists for like a really, really long time, then I'm sure the publishing
of other people will happen, but I’m just kind of taking it publication by publication, exhibition by
exhibition, year by year, at this point.

<br><br>
MARIA:  Other than the book fairs you attend, is there a physical space to purchase Diagonal Press books? Is it something that interests you?

<br><br>
TAUBA:  There are a few bookstores that carry our publications, but you know, my profit margin is so small that
in most cases I can't give the kinds of wholesale discounts that a store needs in order to make it worth
their while. And I don’t want them to mark them up a whole lot either.
I don't have diagonal press in any museum stores.
I definitely have fantasies of having a small physical space that I can design.
