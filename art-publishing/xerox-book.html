        <span id="title">XEROX BOOK</span><br> <br>

        This book exhibition—also known as The Xerox Book—was organized and
        published by
        <a id="seth-siegelaub" href="seth-siegelaub.html">Seth Siegelaub </a>
        <img src="images/seth-siegelaub.jpeg"/>

        in 1968. Both presenting a range of artists
        associated with Siegelaub’s curatorial practice and utilizing unconventional
        modes of exhibition, this book marks ongoing attempt by Siegelaub to show
        work outside of the gallery setting, and his first time showing an exhibition
        in book form. Furthermore, Siegelaub asked each artist in the exhibition to create
        25 pages of work that responded to the photocopy format. Though the Xerox process
        proved financially unfeasible—the works ultimately being reproduced through the
        more conventional printing press—the book continued to be referred to as
        “The Xerox Book,” preserving its association with the then-new photocopy technology.

Participating artists are Carl Andre, Robert Barry,
 Douglas Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris,
 and Lawrence Weiner.
