Publishing as Site-Specific Gesture and Critical Intervention

<br><br>
On this basis, Nick Thurston has developed "an approach to writing by
which someone composes or choreographs how the practices and institutions
at the intersection will affectively inter-relate. This would involve
nominating the resultant text plus its contexts of production, distribution
and reception as altogether the stuff to be read."
<br><br>
This approach has been implemented for instance in Thurston's
recent work Of the Subcontract. Or, Principles of Poetic Right (2013), which
is discussed by him and Hanna Kuusela in their contributions. The poems
in that book were all written by ghostwriters contracted through Amazon's
subsidiary Mechanical Turk (AMT). Every poem is accompanied by
information regarding the number of minutes the unnamed contracted
laborer invested in the poem as well as what Thurston paid for it-anywhere
between 1 cent and 1 dollar. As such, the extraordinarily topical socioeconomic
dimensions of outsourcing, i.e. the precarious post-industrial work
and production conditions in general, become a central theme of the
book and are then given a trial run in the field of poetry, which is typically
seen as being the most authentic genre and the least corrupted or furthest
away from the concerns of the market-yet, following Ulises Carrion
(see above) and Vanessa Place, this view is erroneous. Of the Subcontract
thus presents itself as a space where literary, publishing, and curatorial
practices come into contact with the discourses and institutions from the
economic, social, political, and ethical realms. The publication is then
"a material representation of the textual and contextual processes that were
choreographed to intersect[ ... ] in specific editions, at specific times, each
projected into a specific historico-socio-cultural milieu."
<br><br>
Thurston considers this form of conscious positioning of the intersecting
practices and institutions of publishing as a "site-specific gesture,"
or, as a "site-specific intervention." Whereas the exhibition, gallery,
and museum were regarded-mostly from an institutionally critical perspective-
as the ''site" in the site-specific art of the 1970s, it is the publication
that needs to be established and critically investigated as the "site" in
the literary field,  which is what Fritz Balthaus has stipulated with his
intervention in Brian O'Doherty's collection of texts Inside the White Cube
( ... Annette Gilbert) as being long overdue.
<br><br>
This site-specific and (institutional) critical impetus can also be
accredited to every post-digital work "that takes as its topic the structural,
socioeconomic, and material conditions of its production." In his contribution,
... Hannes Bajohr classifies such works as "factographic." However,
the focal point here is not only the precarious working conditions of today's
artistic production, which Holly Melgard, for instance, has addressed
in her Reimbur$ement (2013): "often I find myself paying to work rather than
being paid for work." It is also the many shortcomings of the POD system
that have been subject to criticism, as ... Hannes Bajohr and Annette
Gilbert have shown in their contributions. In the works of Silvio Lorusso
and Jean Keller, for instance, both the POD and the exaltation of this system,
which has been praised as a refuge for freedom and democracy, have
been demystified. Lorusso's and Keller's works suggest that in the general
enthusiasm for the virtually unlimited artistic freedom in the field of POD
publishing it shouldn't be forgotten that even a predominantly autonomous
author or self-publisher is imposed by boundaries that are determined
by the medium, material, technology, economic relations of production, and
institutional and legal regulations.
<br><br>
Elisabeth Tonnard and Klaus Scheriibel, for instance, have made
these institutional conditions and dependencies on the publishing system the
subject of their publishing projects: Tonnard's The Invisible Book (2012)
is a book that was never written or printed but it can still be purchased and
is considered to be "produced" or "published"; and Scherubel's Mallarme.
The Book (2000-), which consists solely of a cover and a Styrofoam block,
can be found in libraries and bookstores, since it is furnished with an ISBN
and has been fed into the institutional and book trade distribution. Elisabeth
Tonnard and Klaus Scheriibel focus their entire efforts on the framing
conditions of publishing and demonstrate that it is entirely feasible to bring
an invisible or blank "book" into economic and institutional circulation
so long as it has been institutionally "accredited." In this way, according to
Annette Gilbert, they reveal the "externalities" of the publication process
and the powers that bring the publications into existence, which normally
remain invisible.
