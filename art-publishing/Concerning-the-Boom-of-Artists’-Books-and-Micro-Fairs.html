Concerning the Boom of Artists’ Books and Micro Fairs

<br><br>
LF: I would now like to talk about the boom in the artists'
book production and trade that took place over
the last decade. How does the scene itself explain this
development?

<br><br>
BC: The fact that the artist's book is currently experiencing a revival has
certainly to do with the art market itself. Art dealers have discovered
or rather re-discovered, the artist's book as an original and lucrative f'o rm
of art, just as they did in the case of photography, which was regarded
mostly as a reproducible document up to the 1980s. During the 1960s,
the intention of the originators of the genre-Stanley Brouwn, Peter
Downsborough, Sol Le Witt, Ed Ruscha, Dieter Roth, Lawrence Weinerhad
been to create a work of art that was independent of its location, producible
in high numbers and thus cheap to purchase. Titles from this
era possibly saw the most pronounced increase in value on the art market.
Accordingly, dealers, collectors and specialized fairs grew exponentially.
By now, this sphere has created its own form of distribution system,
the so-called micro fairs, where the titles that are produced in this field
can be seen and disseminated.

<br><br>
LF: How old is the phenomenon of micro fairs?

<br><br>
BC: The first fairs emerged in the mid-1990s-Artist's Book Triennial, Vilnius
(1994), Rencontres de l'edition de creation, Marseille (1997), Editions/
Artists' Book Fair, New York (1998)-while most of the more than fifty current
fairs were only founded a few years ago.

A book fair can create encounters between different actors. There are
artists who produce their own books. Then, there are second-hand bookshops
that offer books that are out of print. Additionally, there are publishing
houses, big and small, that only promote their own titles. A micro fair usually
takes place as an additional event of a book fair. It's often the alternative
publishers or publishers of books without ISBN who present very interesting
and enriching titles. Most of these publishers are happy if their book sales
cover their travel expenses. I frequently have to think of Andy Warhol's
statement that, in the future, there will be fifteen minutes of fame for everybody,
since the artists who confidently work with this form of publishing.
are often not interested in the durability of their publication, at least during
certain phases of their personal development. In fact, an artists' books
fair generates a great amount of attention, and it gives like-minded people
the opportunity to meet each other. Personal exchanges and marketing
efforts for one's own work are not at all looked down upon, but rather celebrated.
The processes have accelerated and the so-called micro fairs have
developed into traffic junctions for art.

This also has an influence on certain publishing houses and the artists' book
trade. A new public sphere has developed here, and also a new market place.
In this context, I find the Arts Libris in Barcelona interesting. Together
with Mela Davila Freire, who was the first head of the MAC BA Study Centre
in Barcelona, the Swiss curator Moritz Kiing co-founded this artists' books
fair. This fair also wants to find its own profile and make it more poignant.
In the future, the Arts Libris will try to, for example, attract a larger number
of international participants. To reach this goal, they generate content
themselves-also in order to distinguish itself from other fairs. In 2015, Arts
Libris was organizing, for the second time, an international symposium;
it presented the exhibition This is the Cover of the Book (named after the book
published in 1964 by Fluxus-artist George Brecht); it featured a Speakers'
Comer for exhibitors, where they could present their program, their most
recent publications, or upcoming projects. Then, Arts Libris purchased books
and works available at the fair for the collection of Fundacio Banc Sabadell
and initiated their own series of artists' books, the AL series. It is connected
to a production award for an artist featured at the fair, who will be invited to
present a new title at next year's fair. Kung's aim for the development of Arts
Libris is therefore to find a well-adjusted balance that leads to a reciprocate
interchange of the alternative and the established. Concerning the micro
fairs, it is safe to assume that similar strategies are being developed elsewhere.

With respect to the ability of these formats to temporarily bring
together heterogeneous approaches in art and political discourse, it might
be interesting to note what happened to us recently at the fookbair in
Frankfurt. We were there to present our book NO-ISBN: On Self Publishing
(2015). Parallel to the annual book fair, the Staedelschule, a renowned art
institution, and Merve-Verlag-who publishes books on philosophy, political
theory, and art theory-jointly organized a micro fair. Visitors of the book
fair could also visit an exhibition by the school's graduates. The class
on "Pure Fiction" writing by Mark von Schlegell enacted an experimental
theatre play that attracted more than 300 guests from very diverse crowds
of art. And they managed to blend two formats into each other with the DJ
who followed up with dance music. The conceptual synergies that can arise
from the format of micro fairs are obviously as manifold as the contents
of the artists' books themselves.

<br><br>
LF: I'd like to close our conversation with a reference to the
social anthropologist Arjun Appadurai and his treatise
The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective
from the 1980s. The influence of his theories extended
to the later development of a "material turn" and the "Actor
Network Theory" in the cultural sciences. WithAppadurai,
one can learn to distinguish between such basic terms as
an "object," a "thing," a "tradable good,” an "artifact," and
a "subject." And at the background of such distinctions of terms is, for him, the knowledge that objects possess the potential for social meaning and acting.

But in 1986, Appadurai could not yet foresee the
influence of Amazon or eBay, where all objects potentially
become goods that can be traded throughout the world.
With Facebook and Google, the most complete and up-to-date
profile achieves the highest price, our data shadow is
sold as a tradable good. Therefore, in 2015, Appadurai also
opens a new perspective on your collection of NO-ISBN:
Each of these books presents the subjectivity of a potentially
non-eavesdropped "other." This other does indeed live far
away on the same globe, but they have not held back from
expressing themselves in the materiality of book form and
then allowed this object to circulate freely. Perhaps without
even noticing, he or she has published without becoming
Utah data.3

To conclude, I would like to invite you to present a
prognosis for the future of analog publishing. Will NO-ISBN
be valued in a hundred years as art, or as purchasable products,
just like others? Will they change hands in exchange
for other objects or for an abstract currency? Which role will
the book play in contemporary art?

<br><br>
BC: A one-hundred-year prognosis? Before the 2015 Frankfurt Book Fair,
numerous articles in the press talked about a counter-trend to digitization,
a newly increasing interest in the printed book that could be seen through
various indications-the number of book fair visitors, the interest of the
younger generation, nostalgic bibliophiles. But whatever isn't circulating
online also renounces a form of meaning-that no one can know-in
tomorrow's world. In Vienna, we are, by the way, still working on a platform for artists' books-with or without an ISBN-that individual authors or small publishing houses will be able to use to
present themselves and make their products visible. 4

Concerning the one-hundred-year question: indeed,
what will the form and content of each book still be able
to say about its author, their respective discipline, their place
of origin, their intentions, and cultural environment? In
the end, it is the materiality of the information bearer "artist's
book" that seems to support such a prognosis. I am sure
that in the future, a lot of features of analog printing will
again play a role in society. NO-ISBNs are books, and books
are stable.

3 This term refers to the US
National Security Agency
(NSA), which is setting up the
world's largest digital storage
center in Bluffdale (UT). The
global public learned about
it through the disclosures
of Edward Snowden and the
Academy Award winner
Citizenfour by Laura Poirtras.
Their plans include making
transcripts of conversations,
emails, messages, Skype
conversations, etc., permanently
available upon request
for decades to come.

collection of NO-ISBNs
can be seen there in addition
to information about their
production and the number
of copies printed.
