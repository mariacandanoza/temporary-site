Infinite Hospitality - The Library is a Growing Organism - Melvil Dewey as One-Man Silicon Valley

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: The library essentially is also a structure that is animated by the use of its reader. And therefore it’s important to make it easy to retrieve information. David Senior writes in his essay Infinite Hospitality [fig. 7] about the Indian mathematician and librarian S.R. Ranganathan and his Five Laws of Library Science (1931). “The library is a growing organism” is one of these laws. Ranganathan developed an unorthodox classification system using “facets” where several topics can be linked in a series of keywords in order to describe the various subjects present in a single book.7

<br><br>
Inner Voice: This system creates relationships between the concepts instead of a hierarchical delineation as it is used traditionally by libraries and developed by Melvil Dewey.8

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: Melvil Dewey’s model is still the standard organizing system in many public libraries. But it is not without criticism: his biographer Wayne A. Wiegand interestingly argues that Dewey’s narrow interpretation of objectivity is fully based on “a patriarchal White Western (and, of course, Christian)”9 worldview. What is left out here is a whole range of alternative perspectives on humanity’s knowledge.

<br><br>
Inner Voice: Are you aware that writer Shannon Mattern has described Melvil Dewey “as a one-man Silicon Valley, born a century before Steve Jobs”10? Because in 1876, just after graduating from College, he copyrighted his library classification scheme.

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: More than that! He simultaneously even started a hugely successful furniture business providing the ‘right’ chairs, tables and shelves to libraries. Even in that respect he imposed his control on how libraries had to function according to him.

<br><br>
Inner Voice: Megan Shaw Prelinger from the Prelinger Library in San Francisco talks about the shortcomings of Dewey’s system: “First,” she says, “[our] collection is unique to our combined areas of particular interest. It has never tried to be a general-interest research collection. Second, therefore, the library did not really fit the taxonomic systems of either the Library of Congress or Dewey Decimal. For instance: Art and politics? Handmade films? Nature-culture interface? The history of the demonization of the youth in society? These are just a few of our subject areas that are not clearly articulated in pre-existing taxonomic systems.”11

<br><br>
Inner Voice: Do you know of any examples where people have organized publicly accessible libraries in an alternative way?

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: The Ethical Culture School in New York City for example carried out a radical experiment. They wanted for their students a more independent and empowered seeking practice in their library. Therefore they ditched the Dewey system and developed the Metis system instead, named after the mother of Athena in Greek mythology. They responded to the problem that students frequently were more focused on actually seeking materials rather than using them and along with the kids developed a more usable classification system.12

<br><br>
Inner voice: For example?

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: They discovered, that kids were interested in topics rather than in authors. Some sections were under-used such as “Languages” which were turned into “Community,” “Craft” is now labeled “Making Stuff.” But the most radical step was to mix the classic categories of “fiction” and “non-fiction.”

<br><br>
Inner Voice: Really? That sounds pretty radical.

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: Yes, they found out, that this move triggers thoughts and discussions, where students have to evaluate on their own what is imagination and what is information and discover the blurred lines in between.

<br>7 S. R. Ranganathan outlines the Five Laws of Library Science. “1. Books are for use. 2. Every reader his [or her] book. 3. Every book its reader. 4. Save the time of the user. 5. The library is a growing organism.” “Infinite Hospitality,” in Every Day the Urge Grows Stronger to Get Hold of an Object at Very Close Range by Way of Its Likeness, ed. David Senior (New York: Dexter Sinister, 2008). This unbound collection of 14 folders has been reprinted in Portable Document Format (Berlin: Sternberg Press, 2009) and can be found online at www.dextersinister.org. French writer Georges Perec also came up with a set of unusual categories to organize his personal library— “alphabetically, by continent or country, by colour, by date of acquisition, by date of publication, by format, by genre, by major periods of literary history, by language, by priority for future reading, by binding or by series.” Georges Perec, “Brief Notes on the Art and Manner of Arranging One’s Books,” in Species of Spaces and Other Pieces, ed. John Sturrock (London: Penguin, 1999), 148–155.
<br>8 The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system, based on numbers attributed to nine main categories, was invented in the 1870s. It is extendable, as its numerical sequences can be split up infinitely and new categories added.
<br>9 Wayne A. Wiegand, “The ‘Amherst Method’: The Origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme,” Libraries & Culture 33:2 (spring 1998), 175–194, 183. Wayne A. Wiegand examines meticulously how the conservative mindset at Amherst College, where Dewey was a student and library assistant, shaped Dewey’s concepts of classifications and their hierarchies. “Its moral center was located in ‘Anglo-Saxonism’ a doctrine that defined ‘objectivity’ and touted the unique virtues, mission, and destiny of the AngloSaxon ‘race.’” Ibid. It is quite important to understand, that with the very headings, he came up with, Dewey framed and cemented “a worldview and knowledge structure taught on the tiny Amherst College campus between 1870 and 1875 into what became the world’s most widely used library classification.” Ibid., 188.
<br>10 Shannon Mattern describes Dewey as “the quintessential Industrial Age entrepreneur. […] He helped found the American Library Association, served as founding editor of Library Journal, and launched the American Metric Bureau, which campaigned for adoption of the metric system. He was 24 years old. He had already established the Library Bureau, a company that sold (and helped standardize) library supplies, furniture, media display and storage devices, and equipment for managing the circulation of collection materials. As chief librarian at Columbia College, Dewey established the first library school—called, notably, the School of Library Economy.” Shannon Mattern, “Library as Infrastructure,” Places Magazine, June 2014, https:// placesjournal.org/article/ library-as-infrastructure/.
