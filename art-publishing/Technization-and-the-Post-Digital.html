Technization and the Post Digital

<br><br>
What does it mean for a technology to no longer be new?
German philosopher Hans Blumenberg made a distinction
between "technology" and "technization."10 Technology suggests
itself as discrete matters of fact in the objectivity of its
artifacts. Once introduced, it is there, only to be replaced by
better, newer technology. Technization, on the other hand, is
the ongoing process by which technology fades into the background
of our everyday experience. Blumenberg called this
quotidian consciousness the "life-world," a term borrowed
from Edmund Husserl, who defined it as the "realm of original self-evidences."(11)

<br><br>
For Blumenberg, the life-world is that which in its
unquestionable obviousness (Evidenz, often translated "self-evidence”) lacks all resistance that would make it stick out as conspicuous .
Similar to Heidegger's "readiness-to-hand,”(12) but without his scorn of technology,
Blumenberg described technization as the slow sinking-into-the-lifeworld
of what was once artificial, unnatural, obtrusive, and novel. Any
technology is, in the process of technization, "always-already" on the way
toward this transparency, and becoming invisible to its users. Only a sudden
event of resistance can disturb this process and make it apparent-a resistance
that, as I will show, POD provides.

<br><br>
It seems that, with the initial rise of digital technology more than a
generation behind us, we are now experiencing a threshold moment of such
technization. The fact that something is produced, distributed, or perceived
by digital means is no longer the first thing we notice about it, if we notice it at
all. Digital technology is in the process of losing resistance to our experience
of reality. Gradually, as Blumenberg writes, "The artificial reality, the foreigner
among the encountered things of nature, sinks back into the 'universe
of what is pre-given as obvious', the life-world."(13)

<br><br>
If today's subjects of technization are digital technology
and its practices, then the outcome of this process-their
having become life-world-might be called "the digital."
Thus understood, the digital is, first, the epistemological integral
of digital technology; Blumenberg calls this a "concept of
reality," that is, something that conditions the experience
of the world without itself being apparent as a factor.(14) But
because this process of digital technization is not complete
(after all, we can still be aware of it), the digital does not yet
determine our life-world absolutely. The digital can therefore
also describe, second, a temporality, a threshold moment that
is precariously situated not between the old and the new, but
the "opaquely" novel and the "transparently" evident; it vacillates
between the no-longer and the not-yet. (15)

<br><br>
If the digital is a concept of reality or a temporality,
increasingly transparent to scrutiny, the post-digital is what
performs the sudden yank that makes it apparent again. It
provokes a disharmony in the structure of the obvious, thus
drawing attention to it, and makes the process of technization
experienceable. The post-digital denotes the ontological
status of an object, ambiguously lodged between the
already-evident and the still-new. As soon as it is possible to
question which category applies in a given case, the postdigital
offers the resistance necessary to bring back to consciousness
the otherwise elusive process of technization and
its resulting concept of reality.

<br><br>
What this means is that we don't live in a post-digital, but very much a digital moment. The digital and the postdigital
are not opposed terms, nor does the post-digital come "after" the digital. Rather, they operate on different categorical
planes: As a concept of reality / temporality, the digital is what is disclosed by the ambiguous ontology of the
 post-digital. With Vilem Flusser, one could call the postdigital object an Unding-an object suspended between
 ontological states.(16) A book produced by POD technology has the potential to be a post-digital Unding.
 Its vacillating states are usually described as "analog" and "digital," its forms of presence as material
 and immaterial. The most notable way in which it embodies its ontological ambiguity is in the relation between
 file and product.

<br><br>
POD has an inherent connection to a digital file; its
very existence relies on the creation of a digital master from
which the copies of the book are made. While this is true of
almost any book printed today, with POD this connection
between file and object is especially unstable. Because of the
ease of production and dissemination that services like Lulu
and Blurb provide, it can be investigated, manipulated, and
thrown into crisis by artistic and literary means (Syjuco's
Phantoms already hint in this direction). In turn, as we shall
see, the attributes of the file are determined by the material
constraints of POD. Any inclination to hierarchize the two
elements-the text and the book, the immaterial and its
materialization-thus inevitably fails. "Electronic textuality
is[ ... ] locatable, even though we are not accustomed to thinking
of it in physical terms,"(17)  Matthew Kirschenbaum pointed
out in discussing a "forensic" approach to storage media. This
idea holds for POD as Unding, too; few things illustrate "the
heterogeneity of digital data and its embodied inscriptions"
as well as this post-digital object does.(18)

Blumenberg modifies the
concept of "life-world" considerably.
For him, it does
not describe an actual state,
but acts as a "limit concept"
(Grenzbegriff}, that is,
something that can only be
inferred but never actually
reached. Absolute life-world
would be the absence of all
resistance to reality. He offers
another name: "paradise."

of the "concept of reality"
is too abbreviated to do it
justice and it deserves more
explanation than I can provide

it makes sense to differentiate
between the transparency
of technology and the transparency

first transparency changes
our experience of reality.<br>

digital" as epistemic and
temporal category might help
to restrain the term again
somewhat after its recent
over-expansion, which
has threatened to wipe out
for good any residue of
meaning left in this already
highly vague concept; see

It is hard to find a suitable
English equivalent for the
German term Unding.
While the lexical meaning is
"absurdity," it literally translates
as "non-thing," and this
is how the English version
renders it. But it is a peculiarity
of the German language
to retain what is apparently
negated by the prefix "un-."
Rather, it qualifies something
as questionable in its
essence: An Unmensch is not
a non-human but an inhumane
one, and an Unkraut is
not a non-plant, but one that
is not wanted, or in the wrong
place: a weed. Similarly, an
Unding is a thing whose
very thing-ness is in question.
Jean-Francois Lyotard employed
a similar ambiguity
when he used the plural
for the title of his 1985 Centre
Pompidou exhibition "Les
lmmateriaux." Taking Lyotard
as a cue, a possible translation
for Unding could thus
be "immatter."<br>
