A Library is a Space Where Marketable Goods Are Turned into Public Goods

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: Libraries provide immaterial goods and media that would otherwise have to be purchased. When we try to reduce the book and its knowledge to an object-commodity, we forget that a book is actually brought to life by its readers and not by its sales figures. It’s the reader’s engagement with the book that generates creative and critical thinking, which feeds back into a public domain.

<br><br>
Inner Voice: Sales figures? Commodity? You are not talking about Amm…

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: Amazon, exactly: “Books are easy to ship and hard to break.” That was Amazon’s initial idea. George Packer quoted the company’s former deputy in a piece for the The New Yorker saying: “It wasn’t a love of books that led Jeff Bezos to start an online bookstore. It was totally based on the property of books as a product.”13 As I said: Libraries provide immaterial goods and media that would otherwise have to be purchased.

<br><br>
Inner Voice: Terry Deary, one of the best selling children-book authors, follows up this logic with his remarks about libraries. He recently said in a speech that libraries are not relevant anymore. His argument: it has been 150 years since the Public Libraries Act gave rise to the first free public libraries in the UK, and since then times have changed.

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: It is as scary as it is stupid. He perversely reasons that libraries promote the idea that “we’ve got an entitlement to read books for free, at the expense of authors, publishers and council tax payers. This is not the Victorian age, when we wanted to allow the impoverished access to literature. We pay for compulsory schooling to do that.”14 You can see that current approaches of greed to books as objects of commercial fetish have come a long way from the generous distribution of culture of the Sixties we were just touching on.

<br><br>
Inner Voice: Apparently Deary’s statement triggered lots of hate mail.

<br><br>
Eva Weinmayr: His statement is actually just following a general hidden logic of neoliberalism, permeating every single aspect of our lives. The current intellectual property discourse is cynically shaping our relationship with culture. Andrea Francke, my colleague in The Piracy Project15, recently wrote a passage in an unpublished paper I want to read back to you: “Deary’s conclusion is a perfectly logical one and it was just a matter of time before someone voiced it. That is what makes it so scary. Deary’s mindset tries to turn knowledge into property: It’s yours, you own it. Like a house, a car or a coat that has been passed down through generations shouldn’t you have the right to pass down the rights of your book so your great-great-great grandchildren can live on it. Maybe that’s why the use of ‘commons’ as a synonym for public domain has become so popular by using it we unconsciously confirm the transformation of culture and knowledge into property (even if into a communal one).” And this is very illustrating.

15 The Piracy Project is an international publishing and exhibition project exploring the philosophical, legal, and practical implications of book piracy and creative modes of reproduction. Through research and an international call for submissions, The Piracy Project has gathered a current collection of 200 modified, appropriated, and copied books from all over the world. The collection, which is cataloged online, is the starting point for talks and work groups around the concept of originality, the notion of authorship, and politics of copyright. The Piracy Project is run by Andrea Francke and Eva Weinmayr as part of AND Publishing’s research program. See www. andpublishing.org.
