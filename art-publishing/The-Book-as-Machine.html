The Book as Machine

<br><br>
lt would be a mistake to suppose that the trend towards the oral and acoustic means that the book is becoming obsolete. It means rather that the book, as it loses its monopoly as a cultural form, will acquire new roles. - Marshall McLuhan

<br><br>
Don't look around yourselves for inspiration. We have only one teacher: THE MACHINE. - Nikolai Foregger

<br><br>In the beginnings of our research into narrative we ran up
against the inescapable fact that "there exists no standard
definition of narrative in the sense that writers seem to use
the word." There is so much confusion particularly between
narrative and plot, the two terms being used almost interchangeably.
Thus we feel free to create a definition which is
not in the strictest sense new because there is no existing
old definition. What we need to establish is a working definition
of narrative and then discard it if further research
proves it false or inadequate in scope.

<br><br>For the purpose of this report we will deal with narrative
in print rather than as an oral phenomenon. This will allow
us to eliminate consideration of the innumerable narratives
of daily living that are characterized by their provisionality,
evanescence and intractability. In the strictest sense the
most comprehensive definition of narrative would be simply
our sequential life experience. We will not address this
comprehension but rather deal with narrative as it Occurs
within the specialized area of the print experience.

<br><br>Gertrude Stein put it most simply when she pointed out
that narrative was anyone telling anything to anyone anytime.
When we transpose this definition into print we begin
to recognize two distinct experiences:

<br><br>1. The physical experience of print as word and ink and
the book itself as a physical object.
<br>2 . The psychological and psychosemantic experience of
operating verbal signs.

<br><br>In this first part of our report we will deal with the physical
aspects of the book as machine, documenting some of
the attempts made toward an understanding and reassessment
of physical forms the book has already acquired
and the emerging outline of future forms, considering the
implications of the book's mechanicity and the active application
of such considerations.

<br><br>Backgrounds
<br>By machine we mean the book's capacity and method for
storing information by arresting, in the relatively immutable
form of the printed word, the flow of speech conveying
that information. The book's mechanism is activated when
the reader picks it up, opens the covers, and starts reading
it. Throughout its history (and even prior to Gutenberg) the
book has possessed a relatively standard form varying only
in size, color, shape, and paper texture. In its most obvious
working the book organizes content along three modules:
the lateral flow of the line, the vertical or columnar
build-up of the lines on the page, and thirdly a linear movement
organized through depth (the sequential arrangement
of pages upon pages).

<br><br>Significantly the book assumes its particular physical
format through its design to accommodate printed linguistic
information in a linear form. Taking the line as a practically
impossible continuum, it breaks it up into discrete
units of equal length, placing them one above the other
in sequence until a page unit is filled. Similarly the page
units are ordered sequentially and the whole sewn or glued
together to form the complete book. Already it is possible
to note that the linear experience as continuum has
been significantly altered, for the second and third modules
mentioned are the ones which the book has placed
before our reading pose. In addition the book has underlined
and reinforced the first module so that we now accept
all three as not simply modules but constants which are seldom
questioned. Hence the surprising shock value of typographic
experiments ( evinced by the very fact that they are
labeled experiments).

<br><br>So far in our description of the book as machine we
have dealt with it as a prose print experience. It is important,
however, to point out the difference between the reading
experience of prose and poetry. Prose as print encourages
an inattention to the right-hand margin as a terminal
point. The tendency is encouraged to read continually as
though the book were one extended line. In poetry, by contrast,
the end of each line is integral to the structure of the
poem whether it follows older metrical prosodic models or
more recent types· of breath-line notation. This emphasis
upon the structural aspects of the terminal point of each
visual line unit in the poem is why concrete poetry is called,
in fact, poetry and why the latter word is apt in its description.
In poetry, where the individual line is compositionally
integral, the page is more often than not itself integral.
Most short poems for instance involve a significant degree
of iconicity: we see the poem as a visual whole before we
read it. Perceived optically as a complete unit the page is
qualified to such an extent that it ceases to function as an
arbitrary receptacle, or surface, for the maximum number
of words it can contain (functioning thereby as a random-
sized unit in a larger construct), becoming instead the
frame, landscape, atmosphere within which the poem's own
unity is enacted and reacted upon. Page and type function
as the two ingredients in a verbal sculpture.

<br><br>By contrast, in the majority of prose the general rule
holds that the paragraph-through effecting a visual separation
of sense and event-performs a similar function (optically) to the poetic line. A sentence is not visually
integral until combined with other sentences to form the
paragraph. However, in both prose and the visually continuous
poem (Milton's Paradise Lost for instance) the page
has no optical significance. Being to a large extent a working
out of information through duration, prose structures tend
to be temporal rather than visual. For instance the chapter
can seldom be grasped iconically precisely because the
chapter extends over the surface of several pages, occupying
a part of the depth module which runs from the start of
a book to its end. Even the paragraph's optical quality tends
to be accidental. The effect of this surface extension is to
pressure the reader into moving along as quickly as possible
in the depth module. In extended prose or poetry the page
becomes an obstacle to be overcome. There is a difference
too of urgency in the poetic and prose line. In the former
the left-hand margin is always a starting point, the right hand
margin a terminal, neither of which is determined by
the randomness of page size but rather by the inner necessity
of the compositional process. It becomes obvious how
historically the emphasis on the visual element in writing
would have a poetic emergence, for only in poetry occurs
that bridging point which permits the steps from a significance
through inner necessity ( where each visual terminal
point gains pertinence and value) to a new way of perceiving
in which the visuality becomes, not the end product of
an interior psychological process, but rather the beginning
of a whole new method of perception.

<br><br>There seems to exist at present a dichotomy in attitude
between the book as a machine of reference and the book
as a commodity to be acquired, consumed, and discarded.
Traditional printed narrative is largely thought of as the
transcription of a hypothetical oral activity: a speech line
running from a point of commencement to an end. Such
books transcribe language along horizontal axes running
from top left to bottom right of each page. This occidentally
conventional manner of reading along the length of the
line and down the length of each page from first to last in
actuality reconstitutes the duration of a "listening.” In reference
books such as dictionaries and directories, however, the
oral hypothesis is minimized to the point, perhaps, of nonexistence.
Such books are not thought of as having authors or
a supposed unitary voice behind them. They exist as physical storage
units for information, to be consulted at various
tunes, but not designed to be consumed in a single, linear
duration. Popular fiction, marketed for mass audiences
performs a different function; there the page's nonsequen-,
tial storage qualities are ignored. Nobody would consider
the page of such a book as an area requesting the reader's
free, nonlinear eye movements over a multi-activating, multi-acting surface, but rather as a unit necessarily endured as
a means to the complete reception of the book's information. The current predicament of popular mass fiction is the competitive threat staged by the other great machines of consumption: television and film are indubitably the more efficient media. The reason for this is clear. The book’s power as an object to be dwelt on and referred back to is not a desirable feature. Not only the page but the book in its entirety is conceived as an obstacle to be overcome in order to achieve the desired goal of unproblematic, uninterrupted , unsophisticated consumption. Television and the cinema on the other hand afford more rapid and totally sensorial means of satisfying such an appetite for story. In the light of this phenomenon two important implications of such pre-masticated reading as Readers Digest become obvious. There is a "division of labor" on the reader's part in that he renounces a portion of the total reading role which is performed for him. And secondly the more serious implication of a hierarchical structuring imposed upon the reading experience, by means of which a superior "essence" is thought of as being abstracted from a "lesser" padding. To extend this consumer metaphor we may say that plot is product within linguistic wrapping. Dictionaries and directories work against this status by throwing emphasis onto the single page and the information stored thereon. In their function, dictionaries move much closer to the page-iconicity described above.

<br><br>Narrative then can be developed freely along either of two directions: One rooted in oral traditions and the typographic "freezing" of speech; the other set in an awareness of the page as a visual, tactile unit with its own very separate potential.

<br><br>
Twenty-one facts that could alter your life (send for free Illustrated booklet)
<br>
1. The front page of a newspaper is the paradigm of
typographic cubism. Considered as a multi-page whole,
the newspaper is founded on a model of structural
discontinuity and a principle of competitive attentions.
Front-page stories seldom end on the front page, nor do
they all end on the same interior page. The front page is
an opening made up of many opening terminating on
different pages, which themselves contain other openingsto
read a newspaper as a consecutive experience leads to
extreme discontinuity.
<br>
2. A page is literally one side of a two-sided sheet of
paper-the surface of a three-dimensional object.

<br>3 . If we consider the printless page to be a static, neutral surface, then by applying continuous type to cover the entire surface (as in a page of a novel or this page of a TRG [Toronto Research Group] report) that neutrality is not altered. Where a rectangle of type is placed upon a rectangle of page there is no attempt made to work creatively with the possible tension existing between surface (page) and object on that surface (print). Moreover, in such a placement we invest the page with a secondary quality not inherent to it: viz ., a top left to bottom right orientation (radically different languages such as Chinese and Hebrew impose, of course, a similar directional limitation).

<br>4. When Rabelais (in book 5, chapter 45 of Gargantua and Pantagruel) has the Goddess Bottle speak, she speaks from within a pictorial representation of a bottle. This bottle is not verbally, described but rather imagined on the page; it does not illustrate the story as an appendage, it is an integral part of it.  Like the corporal's stick-flourish in Sterne's Tristam Shandy words are forsaken for a visual instantiation of an object/event.

<br>5. When Simmias of Rhodes composed his Egg, George Herbert his Easter Wings, and Apollinaire his Calligrammes, all were trying to bring together the object signified with the words that signified them. A case of verbal description and the pictorial shape of the object described being joined iconically in a pictorial space.

<br>6. In Tender Buttons, Gertrude Stein's carafe and umbrella are not visually fixed on the page. When all the words inside her at the moment of composition ( of perception) came out they fused perceiver with perceived within the activity of perceiving. The language which described the object also became the object in a physical space.

<br>7. In such poems as "now they found the wagon cat in human body;' "no body speaking;' and other pieces in We Sleep Inside Each Other All, Bill Bissett brings together perceiver and perceived in psychic space which becomes jointly manifest in a pictorial space. Both Stein and Bissett use syntactic rhythm to indicate subjective rhythm; both are dealing with the fundamental relationship between language and consciousness. By moving the poem back into the pictorial space Bissett furthers the visual technique employed by Simmias, Herbert, and Apollinaire, as well as Stein's sense of the autonomous existence of the thing composed.

<br>8. The compositional technique employed by Simmias and Bissett makes a radically different demand upon the page than regular linear transcription. The page ceases to be a neutral surface of support and becomes instead a spatially interacting region; it is granted thereby a metaphorical extension. Conceived as a spatially significant unit, the page carries dimensional and gravitational implications. In Stein’s writing it does not.

<br>9. Pierre Garnier employs the term spatialisme to describe his own particular type of letteristic composition. Garnier developed a theory of the letter as self-sufficing entity existing and operating within an open space or field: the page. This application of a spatial metaphor alters radically the physics of his page. ln his own texts autonomous letters (as objects) occupy a gravitational region, with syntactic emphasis falling on the interval between the letter objects. The  page becomes not only container but definer of the letteristic configuration and becomes additionally a profoundly active space.

<br>10. Spatialisme is a lettristic application of Eugen Gomringer's formal concept of poetic constellation: a word or word cluster balanced-the analog is "electro-magnetically"-within the force field of the page. Both Spatialisme and the constellation deploy the page as a metaphor for space in general. The page is not altered physically but its materiality receives a metaphoric supplement.

<br>11. Page becomes an active space, a meaningful element in the compositional process and the size and shape of it becomes significant variables.

<br>12. The typewriter fixes page size to carriage capacity.

<br>13. In Steve McCaffery's Carnival the carriage capacity limitations are actively confronted. By rejecting its dimensional restriction of size and by forcing it to operate modularly as a smaller unit in a much larger surface, both the page (and its traditional function in the book) are destroyed. Carnival is an anti-book: perforated pages must be physically released, torn from sequence and viewed simultaneously in the larger composite whole. The work demands that language be engaged nonsequentially rather than read in sequence. Altering the physical space allows both book and page to utilize at a maximum their sculptural potential.

<br>14. By replacing the pictorial representation of the thing with its verbal description, Greg Curnoe, in his painted series View of Victoria Hospital 1, exploits the tensions between the viewer/reader's traditional assumptions as to what constitutes both a painting and a page. Curnoe's canvas becomes his page and by implication his page becomes his canvas.

<br>15. John Furnival abandons the page and the book entirely in his language constructs which treat syntax as both physical and environmental matter. Word order becomes panel/architectural layout in his elaborate verbal-architectural labyrinths that replace the complexities of paragraph and sentence. Furnival not only concretizes language but architecturalizes it as well.

<br>16. In the environmental works of Ferdinand Kriwet the pressure to externalize language and alter the mechanics of its reading is achieved by a four-dimensional application that radically modifies the reading space. No longer turning through a book nor looking at a canvas or panel, the reader exists inside a total linguistic environment. As the book constitutes the traditional method for storing verbal information, so the four walls, ceiling, and floor of the gallery become the storage tool for Kriwet's plastic word surfaces. The activation of Kriwet's machine inherently transforms the reader's role and placement. In Dickens you bring the book into your life, with Kriwet you bring your life into the "book:'

<br>17. Hart Broudy is now (1973) effecting a different application of language to environment. Using the photographic principle of the blow-up and applying it to a hybridized work that is both poetry and painting he is arriving at a new kind of optical linguistic environment. The starting point for his compositions is a physical fragmentation of the single letter which then functions as a blueprint for a macro-composition. Text is blown-up to canvas size in which interlocking fragments are magnifies to become giant connected panels. The reader emerges as an active object in a mental paradox: a giant in a miniature world that is larger than his or her self.

<br>18. Fragment from Tom Mot's Seventh Notebook:
... i should try technique of microfiche .. . could compress
my random sequences onto entire card surface ... Swift's
Gulliver ... microcard ... what is it ... microcard in fact
to reinforce upon the large canvas sense its original quality
of print as an isolated experience ... microviewer as
one machine to activate another . . . do this and then
combine microcard with macroprojection say a huge
screen in an auditorium if i can get one ... this way could
get the combination of communal experience with traditional
printed book's isolated experience...

<br>19. Ian Hamilton Finlay, at his home of Stonypath in Scotland, has returned to and revitalized the Renaissance concept of the Book of Nature. Stonypath is essentially a landscape brought into linguistic concerns as a living metaphor. The garden is Finlay's Book in which pages transform themselves to quasi-functional objects. Poems become sundials, gravestones, the page's traditional material opacity becomes the window's clear view into the objects signified. Any traveler through Finlay's garden has to be a reader too; it is a book involving participation of the feet as well as eyes.

<br>20. In their Bi-Point Poetry Manifesto , the French poets Julien Blaine and J.F. Bory urged the abandonment of book and print each in its entirety (save for their minor use in reporting non-typographic language events). The urban landscape provides both alphabet and subject for their work; economic, social, and political factors become syntactic elements. Bory and Blaine's lives and actions become their writing.

<br>21. William Shakespeare (somewhat earlier) spoke ofsermons being in stones and books running in brooks. Finlay's Stonypath and the Blaine-Bory Manifesto are the physical, dynamic applications of a sixteenth-century analogy of Book and Nature.

<br><br>
Afterthoughts
<br>Or what this has to do with anything at all
<br><br>So far we have reviewed/described a specific set of books
and writers from the viewpoint of our own concerns with
the book as machine. Each of them has, for us, significant
comments to make regarding the machine's capacity to alter
function and affect the psychological content of the fictional
reality presented. There are three questions that arise
from our considerations: 1) What are the precise applications
of the solutions arrived at? 2) Does the arrived solution
present a hindrance to "understanding"? 3) Does the
attendant challenge to habitual reading patterns result in
breakthrough or deadlock?

<br><br>These questions have relevance to an interesting text
case: Bill Bissett's special attention to the spelling of words.
Bissett's idiosyncratic orthography and the resultant effects
on that minutest level of reading-the single word-has
already enjoyed a large influence inside Canada. Yet the
writers who have gone on to orthographic modifications in
their own work have been judged mere copiers of Bissett,
rather than valorized as individuals adapting to their own
purposes Bissett's singular insight: that spelling should be
an individual decision and not an imposed norm. Accordingly,
the work of these writers is in danger of being ignored
through the effects of attitude that sees formal innovation
as a novelty and, by extension, as unrepeatable. In the background
of such an attitude lurks the hulking form of traditional
literature as a pre-established, easily subsumed and
hence "safe" finite number of technical solutions.

<br><br>To answer the above questions will require the deployment
of each single isolated experiment in order that comparative
assessments can be made among the experiments
themselves. Consequently the answers to these questions
lie outside the limits of this present article in the future
writing/research to be done. What we will argue for here is
an expanded awareness of both the effects on and the possibilities
for narrative, by an active and thorough utilization
of the book-as-machine.
