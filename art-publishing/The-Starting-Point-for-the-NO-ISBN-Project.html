The Starting Point for the NO-ISBN Project

<br><br>
LF: How is your current involvement in the self-publishing
scene and NO-ISBN related to the proce-ss of collecting
books in the Salon für Kunstbuch (Salon for Artists' books)?

<br><br>
BC: At the beginning of a process like this, there's nothing more than the notion
of a possible "subject." A few artists' books by my peers inspired me, and
I also created a few. That sparked my curiosity, and I simply pursued it. As
an artist what impressed me most was the potential for direct translation: in
self-publishing people act without filters. In some of the works, the artist' s
affects and perceptions lead to an odd, deeply personal type of expression.

<br><br>
NO-ISBN is only one part of this, a subgroup of my general interest
in books and the art that is produced around the world-its existence only
became visible gradually. The development of NO-ISBN as an independent
concept is inherent to the material itself. In the first years of the Salon
I noticed that a lot of the artists' books I had were missing an ISBN. What
defines these books is, as it were, a silent "no." I reacted to that in 2009 with
a poster performance at MoMA PSl in New York. I simply sent out a public
call for people to send books without an ISBN to the Salon in Vienna [fig. 1].

<br><br>
What really surprised me was that nearly 500 books arrived over the
next few weeks. This was not even a singular incident. Hubert Kretschmer
from Munich, an expert of the history of artists' books since the 1970s,1
experienced something similar about three decades earlier. In 1978, with his
recently founded producers' gallery, he put an advert in Kunstforum,
the leading German art magazine of that time. In the advert, he called for
contributions for an exhibition of recent artists' books that he wanted to host
at his private home. He received approximately 250 copies. He described
this unexpected feedback as "kicking the hornets' nest." Kretschmer also
mentioned similar practices of collecting within an art context, such as the
mail art movement, in which letters, and also objects, are exchanged across
different countries, even across the borders of countries with censorship
regimes. Very clear rules were established for mail art. For instance,
whoever called for an exhibition of mail artworks automatically committed
herself to returning a minimal catalog of the works, including any new
addresses, to everyone involved. In this slow give and take process,
each individual exhibition could increase each participant's potential for networking.

<br><br>
Most books in my collection came from the U.S., Europe, and Japan,
that is, from the Western cultural sphere after World War II. The mailing
lists of today's self-publishing scenes were also crucial for this result. These
same books have formed the base inventory of my material
collection ever since and I use them as a starting point
for developing artworks and new concepts.
