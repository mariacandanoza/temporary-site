<br><br>
The book as future of the past

<br><br>
This Is because of you. Spread all over the world you
write, draw, type, take pictures, collage, glue, fold, staple
and print. Expressing your ideas, feelings, views and share
it with an audience.

<br><br>Never before it was so easy to publish and spread your
own thoughts, and yes, in these days you don't even need
a sheet of paper to do this. But that's not the point. To do
it the analog way bears some advantages because self-publishing
is not about spreading at all. It's about autonomy.

<br><br>It's about defining a space after your imagination. It's
about meeting someone else at eye level. It's about celebrating
anarchy. It's about exchanging ideas by swapping a zine
for a zine. It's about an eye-to-eye communication.

<br><br>Zines bear an unbelievable aesthetic and political dimension,
when looked at as motivation for self-publishing and
their production process as do-it-yourself or low-budget
products.

<br><br>Artzlnes go beyond the established business or perception
of art. They radicalize positions on art in many ways by
creating hopes and expressing critique and are themselves
intersections of actual artistic practice.

<br><br>Artzines fight an indefatigable battle against the aesthetic
Gleichschaltung, they created an epic scene around
the arts and a struggle for the attention of the awoken.

<br><br>Aesthetic and culturally traditional work-processes are
being (re-) thought by self-publishing artists or critically
embraced or commented by the more established.

<br><br>They provide evidence of the world's scrap and the seemingly
infinite availability and waste of pictures, they speak
of the democratization of knowledge, of revolution and the
empowerment of the individuals and their wonderful insolence
to take what is theirs. They sparkle and shine aurally,
they are the light above the abyss we have to face from time
to time.

<br><br>Zinesters, you are young and ambitious.
<br>You borrow money.
<br>You do strange things.
<br>Your guest room is occupied by a risograph.
<br>You act when others are asleep and
trawl your thoughts.
<br>You highlight the world's complexity and yet
ask for resonance.
<br>You want to join art with real life and question
the tyranny of tradition.
<br>But yet you love the common things, poetry,
fashion, the line.
<br>You are observers of the humankind, the
gestures, dramas ' you love the fog, let all
things visible disappear, but you succeed in
telling and trusting us with the most absurd.
<br>This is why you inspire us.
<br>Please keep shining!
