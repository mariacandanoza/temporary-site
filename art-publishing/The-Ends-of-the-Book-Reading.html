The Ends of the Book Reading, Economies, and Publics

<br><br>
The crisis in publishing is the collapse of the book as a commodity, as a nexus for shopping. 'That's it. That’s  the bottom line that has destroyed livelihoods and can wreck corporations. Ironically, this catastrophe also blinds publishers to a vibrant resurgence in the culture of reading. Reading and shopping have never been a good match-I would say they are opposites. As the publishing industry struggles to configure new sites of shopping and rescue an economy that used to support writers by selling books, vibrant new communities of reading emerge, both online and in small-run printed books. For those of us who love reading, for those of us who are sick and tired of shopping, this is a remarkable time rife with opportunity. The question we're faced with is not, as so many publishers believe, how to rescue shopping; the question is how to make a viable economy in a culture of reading.

<br><br>In 2009 I learned of cheap, hand-operated machines
that can make sturdy perfect-bound books one-at-a-time,
fast and at low cost. I bought them and, with a friend, set
up shop in a storefront in Portland, Oregon. Like a lot of
people, we knew some great writers whose work we loved
and thought should be published. We became publishers
by printing, binding, and selling their books one-at-a-time
directly to the readers who wanted them. We also offered
the books for sale as eBooks, and we let anyone read and
annotate them for free online in a digital "free reading commons.”
We made a website to sell and circulate the books
globally, while also hosting the social life of the books back
home at our storefront. Friends visited and liked what they
saw. In eight other cities, mostly in North America, friends
bought similar machines and opened up their own shops.
The nine shops together comprise what we call Publication
Studio. In five years, we've published 300 new titles, all
of them profitable. Publication Studio has made a viable,
unsubsidized, for-profit economy based in reading. This is
the story of how.

<br><br>Reading and Shopping
<br>Reading is a specific practice. We know it best as reading
books, but it's a practice that we can apply generally. Reading
is open-ended, provisional, conversational. It's not solitary,
but deeply collective. We might be alone with a book,
but the book fills our heads with other voices and puts our
thoughts into conversation, not only with the writer but
With countless other readers, real and imagined. Immersed
in reading, the self dissolves and mixes with others. We
take comfort in the flickering, light-dappled margin, where
we stand both inside and outside of the text. It is a liminal
space. The relationships of reading are multi-valent, empathetic-
they entail recognition across difference. Texts
have many readers, divergent participants positioned at the
edges of a shared central space; we recognize each other in common across that space, not erasing difference but living in it. Such relationships are not limited to books, but can also play out in the world.
Reading can shape an economy. I call that practice "publication:'
I'm going to draw things in sharp contrast to clarify
the practice. Publication is the creation of new publics
in a culture of reading. It includes the production and circulation
of books, the management of a digital commons,
and a rich social life of gathering and conversation with
books and readers. All of these activities together construct
a space of conversation, a public space, which beckons
a public into being. Shopping-which is the prevailing
culture of our time, and which drives most of the choices
now being made in the publishing industry-corrodes and
evacuates publics. So, real publication begins by quieting
the noise of shopping.

<br><br>The culture of shopping is pervasive. What exactly does it
do to you? Shopping stages the repeated performance of the
self along rigorously organized lines. The purchase is its pivotal
moment. Every minute of every day shopping positions
us on the verge of a purchase, a consumer choice. We stand
ready, groomed for this moment by constantly cycling messages
about our taste and; its meanings. You know these
messages-announcements addressing you by name; mail
slots stuffed with personal offers; objects that beckon you,
eliciting your enactment of taste within very narrow, in fact
dictated, confines. The act of choosing becomes a repeated
affirmation of your selfhood and liberty.

<br><br>Shopping positions you alone in the spotlight, center
stage, performing the correct, repeated display of your
taste. It atomizes us. Shopping is the opposite of reading.

<br><br>Readers naturally quiet the noise of shopping. We're
distracted, which deafens us, and we fail to act. We go
on reading. Not just books, but all those open, inconclusive
relationships that reading entails. Beckoned to move
into the spotlight and decisively exercise our taste, to consume,
we instead dawdle in ambivalence, in the lingering
incompleteness of the text. We keep circling, reading,
rereading, cycling into the next book even before we've finished
the last, so that the two books remain open, and then
more; ten, fifteen books opened or book-marked, cluttering
the room. We stay engaged. The clerk asks us what we'd
like to buy, and we look up, half-focused in the space of
reading, and we answer with a question. We invite the clerk
into a conversation that might never be completed. These
are the pleasures of reading, and if.given serious attention,
they shape an economy called publication.

<br><br>Publication with Friends
<br>About four years ago a woman named Jacqueline Suskin
told me she'd been collecting old photographs from tag
sales, thrift stores, even from the piles of garbage people leave in the street after cleaning out a basement or an attic. Mostly snapshots of travel and families. She had scores of them. The photos were haunting, not only because Jacqueline was drawn to haunting images, but because of the way they reached her. Many were bent and torn, deeply marked by the neglect and time that separated them from the lives they came from. Jacqueline had been writing poems from these photos.

<br><br>She gave me a manuscript. The poems were lovely. Deft,
slight things that graced the images by remaining quiet and
understated. The language was bold, sometimes funny, and
drew attention to itself, though the speaker did not-she
framed and tended the slight margin the world had left
around these photos, condu~ting her business of writing
there and leaving the spotlight to the pictures. Jacqueline's
poems were modest, but I got lost in them. It was an odd
book. Jacqueline wanted to print each photograph in full
color, opposite each poem. I kept going back to three or
four poems that stuck with me, and I grew to love the book.

<br><br>In traditional publishing there's a moment when the
pleasure of reading must stop. Usually that moment is
marked by the sad sentence, "I love your book, but I can't
publish it." The disappointed writer concludes that the editor
is either a cold-hearted liar or a fool. In fact the editor
is neither. The editor is someone who sincerely loves books
but lives in a special kind of hell where hundreds, if not
thousands, of talented writers are motivated to send her
their very best work, which she is obliged to read, often to
love, and to reject over and over and over. The sentence she
writes a dozen times a day, in all sincerity, is "I love your
book, but I can't publish it." This is publishing's hellish negative
to shopping's moment of affirmation-the repeated
performance of the discerning self saying "no" to what she
loves. It is anathema to readers.

<br><br>Publication-an economy based in reading-extends
the pleasures of reading deeper. Having read a book, the
editor's reply is either "I love your book, I want to publish
it." Or, "I don't love your book, good luck." Because
we make our books one at a time as they are purchased,
and we organize our work around the relationship of one
reader to one book, any book we love can be published
profitably. We make books for readers who want them, so
we have costs only when we also have income from selling
the book.

<br><br>I emailed Jacqueline and said, "I love your book, we want
to publish it." She was thrilled. I explained that this meant
we would make books for anyone who wanted them, but
one-at-a-time; and we would only send books to stores if
the stores bought them, agreed to keep them, sell them, and
never return them. We offered the stores a 40% discount so
they could make their customary profits. Jacqueline would
get half the profit on every book we sold. The way things
got priced, that meant she made about $4 on each sale. The book is eighty pages, lovely and modest, like the poems, and it's called The Collected.

<br><br>It turned out Jacqueline had friends in Portland. She
wanted to come up from Arcata, California, the pot-grow.
ing capital of the us, where she lived and did her work as
"poem store." (Poem Store is a project she shares with poet
Zachary Houston. They set up a typewriter on the street
and write poems for strangers, on themes of the custom.
er's choosing; poems cost $1 each.) Why not bring Poern
Store north and have a Portland launch party for The Collected?
Jacqueline would read and her friend's band would
play. We’d invite all our friends. Jacqueline likes to travel,
and we agreed it was a great idea and started planning the
party, spreading the word, and making books to sell at the
event.

<br><br>Agreements in traditional publishing are a little different.
Let's say it's a good day in publishing, and that rare
pleasure has appeared, the letter or phone call saying "I
love your book, we want to publish it.” The editor offers
a contract and an advance-which is a wager, money bet
against future sales-in exchange for the writer's promise
to not allow anyone else to publish the same work. The
standard publishing contract pivots on this prohibition-the
writer is paid for agreeing to not offer her work to others.
(Advances can be big or small and are becoming less
common, but the promi1,e of exclusivity remains at the core
of the publishing contract.) Without an exclusive right to
publish, the old wisdom goes, the market will be flooded
and profits will be lost.

<br><br>Given the bet that the publisher has made-in the form
of any advance payments, printing and distribution of a
print run, and pushing that run into stores or book-media
quickly enough to sell copies before the book is old or irrelevant-
the need for exclusive rights makes sense. But it is
an ugly way to begin a crucial relationship.

<br><br>By contrast, publication-driven by a reader's hopes for .
the book he loves-begins with a nonexclusive contract.
We ask the writer for permission to make our edition of her
work. We welcome, encourage, and even help the writer
find other publishers to make other editions and join in
support of the writer's work. An economy shaped by oneat-
a-time production, focused on the relationship of one
reader to one book, makes money one sale at a time. For us,
the "lost sale" is a meaningless fiction.

<br><br>Further, in publication there are no hidden bets, no history of speculation weighing the fates of our books unequally. We don't have a thousand copies of Jacque line's book in a warehouse or out in the stores waiting to be sold. We don’t even have two copies. We have Jacqueline’s permission to publish our edition, to make and sell copies as needed to readers who want the book, and we intend to keep doing so forever.

<br><br>I wish the next turn in my story was the appearance of a second excited publisher who also loved Jacqueline’s work and called to say, "Yes, we'd like to publish an edition too.”  Sadly it's not. And when that second publisher does call it Is more likely that they'll say, "We love your book and would you please stop working with Publication Studio, so that we can take over and do a proper job of publishing you?”  But that day has yet to come; so, instead let me tell you about the party.

<br><br>It was a great party. Jacqueline's dad came from
Cincinnati and brought a lot of booze. A local cafe made
snacks that could have been meals, and everyone crowded
into this weird skater/crafty gallery that's down the street
from us, where they like books and thought it would be
cool to have a poetry reading. Jacqueline is an excellent
reader. She showed some of the photos on slides as she
read. 1be friend's band was called "and and and;' and they
were awesome. By the time they played we'd drunk all the
booze and people were dancing on tables. The place is tiny,
so it was packed. The gamble we took--making forty copies
ahead of time for the party-paid off. We sold all forty.

<br><br>This was a good start. Given the way that we work it
could also be the end. Maybe Jacqueline really prefers staying
home. You know writers. She's working on a new book.
The party was fun and, hey, she made $160. But why do
more? As it turns out, Jacqueline is a restless and social person.
Over the next year she made similar events in dozens
of other cities and sold hundreds of books. Some of the parties
were in bookstores that now carry her work. And other
stores heard about it and ordered the book from us. I'll tell
you more about The Collected in a second, but first let's look
at that new book that Jacqueline is working on. Let's say it's
a novel, or just a good long story, and it's brilliant-smart,
empathetic, fierce, like Jacqueline's poems. And this time
the good news comes: Knopf wants to publish their edition
alongside the Publication Studio edition Jacqueline insists
on. (I'm imagining here.)

<br><br>At this point a second difference between publishing and
publication appears. Having leapt bravely into the future
of nonexclusive rights, Knopf must still make a guess, a
wager, that will oblige them to pursue certain time-pressured
strategies on behalf of the book. How many to print?
Thousands? Tens of thousands? What if Terry Gross inter-
Views Jacqueline? What if Michelle Obama gets ahold of
the book and loves it? In what season to bring it out? Who
Is  the market for this book, and how to reach them in the
three-or four-month window that a new book has to spark
interest and sell enough copies to stay in print?

<br><br>At Publication Studio, our challenge is a little more manageable. No bets weigh on our books. The day Jacqueline approves the final design and we're all happy with it, we Print one and marvel at it. It's a wonderful day. That copy goes to Jacqueline, of course. Then we print a second one and we send it to Joy Williams. (Again, just imagining, "for instance...") She knows Jacqueline's work, met her on the street at a Poem Store in Florida. Joy likes the work and they’ve kept in touch; so Jacqueline scribbles a note to include with the book when we pop it in the mail. We take our time. Publication, the creation of a public shaped by reading is not time-pressured.

<br><br>This economy is starting to look a lot like an older model
of publishing. Book lovers writing to friends whom they
think might love a new book, or a not-so-new one. Where
the ease, surprises, and readerly indirection of old publishing
(as recent, say, as Bennet Cerf's Random House
or James Laughlin's New Directions) were the product of
lower profit pressures, steadier back-list sales, or simply
wealth, the opportunity to return to that model-to publish
what we love at a pace that befits our enduring care for
it-now extends to those of us with very little money, no
subsidies, and no back-list.

<br><br>Through the efficiencies of one-at-a-time production
and the broad reach of digital circulation and the internet,
Publication Studio has been able to make profitable
strategies for 300 new titles, channeling all of our earnings
directly back into the social life of the book. We've
made and sold more than 25,000 books, with zero returns,
directly to readers and through 50 or so bookstores around
the world, stores that work with us because they saw our
books and wanted them. Echoing our excitement and loyalty
as readers, those stores also agree to never return the
books we send to them. They buy our books because they
believe the books are worth buying.

<br><br>The Collected is in stores in Paris, Berlin, London, and
many cities across North America. We've sold around 300
copies. Most of the copies sold at events where Jacqueline
reads. It helps that she loves to travel and she's a good
reader. But as the books sell and circulate, online orders
and interest from bookstores both rise. Instead of the apocalyptic
model of traditional publishing, where the book is
visible everywhere for three or four months before disappearing
completely, its last bubbles rippling the surface
of the remainder tables before going under completely,
Jacqueline's book remains visible in the hands of those who
love it and who will speak for it. Its presence is a low, rich
hum that has grown, not a loud shout followed by a startling
silence.

<br><br>Publication with Strangers

<br>If publication is the creation of new publics, how does this
constitute "a public?" How can 300 books make a difference?
And how can a writer live on so little money?

<br><br>First the money. Jacqueline lives the way that most published
poets do. She works various jobs and hopes for
prizes while depending on the peripatetic life of her book
to spread the word. Sometimes we think that famous poets
make money from their work, but they mostly make money
by being famous, not by selling books. Heather McHugh,
a MacArthur fellow and a leading figure in American letters,
tells me no book of hers has ever made more than five
thousand dollars. And that's the high end of the poetry
economy.

<br><br>Writers, not just poets but all literary writers-up to and
including the famous ones-do not make a living selling
books. They could make a living on the winning end of a publisher's foolish advance, but more often than not, the
big advance is a dangerous end game, one that is becoming
increasingly rare. Writers make their money elsewhere, with
prizes and teaching and gigs that stem from their achievements
as writers. So, books are crucial, but book sales do
not comprise a living wage, even for most well-known writers.
It's important to dispel the myth of "making it" so that
younger writers can tum away from that false promise.

<br><br>ln publication, our writers will make money from the
books we sell. They'll make their fair share, but they won't
make a living. So it is for writers in these times. Publishers
should aim to not be wasteful and be sure everyone profits
equally. And they should concentrate their energy on
the more important question of publication-how to make
new and lasting publics?

<br><br>How do publics grow from such small numbers? The
publics that matter, that can shape or change our lives and
the fate of books, do not depend on numbers. The misconception
that they do-that publics become significant only
as they get bigger; mass movements catalyzing when the
sheer size of a crowd or a vote or a poll overwhelms the
size of opposition to it-begins in an age-old confusion of
publics and markets. The first naming of "the public" as
an identifiable political force came simultaneously with the
emergence of "mass markets" as a force shaping European
economies in the late-eighteenth century. What we have
come to regard as democratic forces, "the people" -this
abstraction that is measured in numbers, either of bodies
in a crowd, votes at an election, or units sold-is actually
the buying power of effectively interchangeable consumers
positioned at the end of a new economic form, global capitalism,
that required vastly expanding markets to sustain its
core engines of growth.

<br><br>I won't expect anyone to be swayed by my thumbnail history'.
But look at the discussion of "the public" that's encapsulated
by Jurgen Habermas in his mid-twentieth century
analysis of these concepts, and you'll see the confusion
between markets and publics that I am speaking of. The point that's relevant here is to separate the two. We want to know how to make new publics, not markets. And to do so, we must focus on the quality of relationships, not on their number. Mistaking publics for markets, we have wrongly assumed that their power or importance can be measured by a head-count.

<br><br>A plaza of holiday shoppers, no matter how crowded or busy, does not shape a public. The atomized shoppers lack the crucial recognition of one another, the capacity to see each other and act in common. When we engage strangers as people, when we find ourselves partly by finding their selves, we catalyze a public. When we withdraw that recognition and categorically exclude or erase them, we retreat into something that is not public. Usually it is a market. The catalyzing or erasure of publicness is palpable. You can fed it as you enter a plaza or a crowd, and either recoil from strangers, withdrawing in revulsion, or engage and act toward these strangers as you would towards those you know. In this spark of recognition , of common humanity across difference, you feel a public kindled; you feel its flame grow.
There is no preexisting public. Publics begin in wilful actions, an invitation, an event. A public can arise in any defined space that is open to strangers-a street, a meeting hall, a plaza or park, or a book-and is best supported by small, formally clear settings where there is an obvious threshold to be crossed. An invitation to join literal or implied, is crucial. A good example is the cover of a book which can be opened, or closed.

<br><br>We catalyze publics when we make and circulate books.
The book held in a stranger's hands welcomes him into a
space shared by others. A used book might even bear their
marks, notes scribbled in the margins. I sometimes find
used copies of my own books annotated by readers whose
fanciful conclusions I can only marvel at. "Bird imagery
here:' throughout the margins of my first novel, Landscape:
Memory, seemed to me to be evidence of some misguided
undergraduate instructor who had assigned my book in
the hopes of "teaching it." In another copy I found the
exclamation "omg" beside the book's first detailed description
of oral sex. The notation thrilled me. I pictured a wide eyed
reader, rapt with fascination, a complete stranger for
whom this event had meant as much as it had meant to me.

<br><br>My grandmother read these same-sex scenes, decades
ago, and she sent me a heart-warming note, thanking me
for portraying a romance between two boys "without any
graphic sexual content:' She'd read the whole book, closely;
but what she did not want to see did not impose itself on
her. In this way, books are especially welcoming public
spaces; they offer everything, but don't force it on you. You
can flip ahead, glaze over, or close the book and sigh.

<br><br>My book's public includes my grandmother and the misguided members of the undergrad class, clutching their marked-up copies, and the book groups who adopted it, and the nervous teens whose counselors put it on lists of "gay and lesbian youth novels,” and the travelers who find it in one hostel and leave it, later, in another.  Books travel through the world collecting strangers. They are public spaces. Readers meet in the margins, at the flickering, light-dappled edge of a text they share in common.  You know this moment of recognition-in a crowded subway car or on the benches of a public park, when you see a stranger reading the same obscure book that has meant the world to you. It's a powerful and unfailing link.  Books make publics. And these things grow, especially if we organize our work to help them grow, rather than killing them young if they fail to achieve certain market metrics, the  metrics of shopping.

<br><br>Some books will circulate widely , and their publics grow large.  Our Walter Benjamin books, with Carl Skoggard’s suburb new translation, have an international readership that grows each month, without the kind of social life or support that Jacqueline Suskin brings to her books.  In this case, the books themselves speak clearly.  Joe Holtzman, Carl Skoggard’s partner, and the founder and designer of Nest magazine, where I worked, designed the covers.  We told Carl, no printer covers, only recycled file folders and rubber stamps.  He told Joe, and the results were brilliant.  The books sell anywhere we place them.

<br><br>Other books aren't meant to travel. My neighbors in North Portland, the painters Chris Johanson and Johanna Jackson, painted a mural on the side of our local grocery store. It's beautiful. They made ten watercolor studies for the mural. They letter-pressed the pages with a local printer and hand-painted thirty-six sets of them. We bound the sets as books, thirty-six copies. Almost all are in the .hands of neighbors and friends now, but a few are in Amsterdam and Berlin, and there's one in the Beinecke Library collection of American literature.

<br><br>Other books travel and grow significant publics, but
they do so unpredictably over time. They live out the social
life of the book, within lives shaped by reading, not shopping.
There's no telling where they will go, only that each
book will have its own unique life and its own public, however
big or small. Publication, the economy we've shaped
around the relationships of reading, can treat each one on
its own terms, giving them attention and producing books
for sale when needed, and letting them lay idle when not.

<br><br>Publication as an Economy
<br>
In 2011 I published my fifth novel, Chloe Jarren's La Cucaracha,
using Publication Studio, this apparatus I'd been
touting to my colleagues. I got in touch with friends in
a dozen cities, people who had read my books and knew
my work. Six of those were friends running Publication Studios, making books, hosting events, hosting the economy
of publication. In each city we set up a dinner-one
big table of forty to fifty people, a local chef who was game
for an unusual gig, great food and drink, and sometimes a
special guest, usually another writer, with whom I'd have
a conversation as part of our gathering. Seats at the tables
cost S45 to $75, depending on what the chef had in mind.
They were lavish. The seats were tout compris, all the
booze and wages for the servers and chef, and, importantly,
a copy of my book. We set the ticket price by figuring out
the total costs of the event, including the cost of the book, and dividing that by the number of seats. Anywhere PS had a studio they made the books fresh in editions unique to the event, date stamped, as we do with all our books.

<br><br>In two weeks, having these big dinners almost every nigh in San Francisco, Dallas, Mexico City, Guanajuato, Los Angeles, Vancouver, BC, Toronto, North Adams, MA, New York, Seattle, and Portland, I met 500 people and sold 500 books (and made $5 on each book sold). It was exhausting, thrilling, and buoying. The connections I made over the long hours at these dinner tables meant more than most I’ve made reading to bookstore audiences, where shoppers sit and try to decide if my book is worth buying. And pragmatically, they mean much much more. We don't just make sales. We meet readers, a more enduring thing.

<br><br>It helped that I'd published four books before and had had some earlier success. I doubt that many first-time authors could do what I did. But if we make an economy based in reading, shift our attentions away from shopping and the allure of big publisher's gambling, and back onto the relationships that mean so much to us, writers will begin to see and engage the potentials I was lucky enough to find that summer. They're there. The audience is as ready for change as we are; they're ready to be addressed as readers sharing the common space of a book, strangers ready to recognize each other across difference.

<br><br>This is publication, the creation of new publics. We're
fortunate to live in a time when it has become robustly
possible, even for those of us without means or investors,
equipped only with our love of books. The printed bookmade
and sold one-at-a-time to readers who want themturns
out to be the best, indeed irreplaceable, instrument
of publication (better, even, than its temperamental, disappearing
cousin, the eBook), even if it might be a poor
driver of sales.

<br><br>From Publishing to Publication
<br>
We still shop in a culture of reading, just as we still read
in a culture of shopping. The skilled reader might be bad
at shopping, too slow and indecisive, just as skilled shoppers
are often lousy readers ( too impatient to finish, not to
read but to "have read" and to get on to the next book). But
the two coexist. A culture of reading makes an economy
that is, like reading itself, slower than shopping. It's conversational,
open-ended, interested in detail, difference; it
goes on and on, back-and-forth; it accepts what is available,
rather than unilaterally demanding satisfaction. Shops
like Henry, in Hudson, New York, or Ooga Booga, in Los
Angeles, or hundreds more in scores of other cities, show
us the viable economy of a culture of reading. It's relaxing
and always interesting. Yes, it's slow, but big things happen,
and it's steady.

<br><br>The simultaneous viability-even thriving-of this
"reading economy" amidst the _prevalent economy of shopping
is probably most obvious today in the food industry.
The food industry is dominated by what's called agribusiness,
the massive companies like Monsanto that reward
industrial scale farming by linking those suppliers to vast
distribution networks and global markets where consumers
become accustomed to the convenience of brand-name
pre-packaged foods, foods whose origins and economy the
consumer remains unaware of.

<br><br>Amid this dominant culture of industrial-scale food
production, there is a multi-headed, multi-rooted, swiftly
spreading sort of"blackberry vine" called "slow food;' which
has many different versions in different nations and cultures.

<br><br>The essence of slow food is that the person who eats knows
something about the place their food comes from, who produces
it, and how it gets to the table. This knowledge-more
so than any strict rules about scale or distance-defines
"slow food." It's not really that slow. Since the easiest version
is to grow food in your back yard and eat it ( or, similarly, to
visit the nearest farmer, or yard, with good food, and buy
theirs and eat it), "slow food" can actually be a lot faster than
agribusiness. The difference is in the knowledge one has and
in the relationships that lead to it. These are relationships
of reading-open-ended, conversational, back-and-forth,
enduring, curious, never unilaterally demanding.

<br><br>Publication, the economy I've been describing, is the
books' equivalent of "slow food:' It's local. It's made by
hand by people who care. It carries the best quality work in
the world, and (because literature travels well) publication
gives us access to the entire world of books, not just what is
geographically near-at-hand. I like this economy because I
love reading.

<br><br>It is just as viable as slow food. It exists and can thrive,
regardless of the fate of traditional big publishing. My hope
is that anyone who values a culture of reading above that of
shopping will actively join in the economy of publication.
First we do so by insisting on nonexclusive contracts. Second,
we discourage gambling on big print-runs. Third, we
extend the pleasures of reading as deeply into this economy
as they can possibly go.

<br><br>Reading is not just that thing we do with books, on those
luxurious evenings when we've canceled plans at the last
minute, set a fire in the fireplace, and sit down to read
without obligation until bedtime: it is also the thing we do
throughout the day in all of our relationships and interactions-
with our economy. We can be readers rather than
