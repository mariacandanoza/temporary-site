<br><br>
Publishing and the Public Sphere, or: Publishing as a Political Issue

<br><br>
In a very programmatic text that is often invoked in the publishing as artistic
practice discourse, Matthew Stadler, a co-founder of Publication Studio,
refers to the publication of a text as "a political act [ ... ], which creates a
political space called public space." The established connection between
politics, the public sphere, and publishing is not a matter of chance. From
a media history perspective, the concept of the modern public sphere is in
fact strongly related to the practice of publishing since it was print that led to
the "invention" of the modern public sphere. A new "media constellation"
resulted from the printing press, and subsequently writing had two different
media to choose from: "this alternative enabled and forced a functional
differentiation, in the course of which both the manuscript as well as print
took on new cultural and textual tasks." Since then, the connotation of
handwriting is usually associated with the private sphere and something that
has remained unfinished and the printed text is associated with the public
sphere and something that has been brought to completion. Printing grants
a text "a higher quality and dignity" and because of the enlarged public
sphere that it reaches, it also has a larger political '"explosive power."' It can
be said, then, that "the printed word" has become "the core of the modern
public sphere."
<br><br>
This is the reason why publishing quickly becomes a political issue.
But it also explains why any restriction on this public sphere receives a highly
sensitive reaction: "Books need to circulate to have an impact by being read.
[ ... ] Owning a book is fine but it still needs to be accessible" (Eva Weinmayr).
As such, the diverse "ways to suppress the publishing of, the access to, or the
distribution of texts and books" are closely followed by the arts and literature
and, as Eva Weinmayr documents, any form of suppression arouses
opposition and "creative subversion" by the activists in the scene. Thus, contemporary
artistic interventions are clearly rooted in the tradition of counterculture
that ranges from the Whole Earth Catalog, the Revolting Librarians,
and the "sozialisierter Druck" (pirate edition) of the student movement.
Focusing on samizdat, Valentina Parisi considers it to be a similar kind of
self-publishing practice to those in the counterculture tradition.
<br><br>
In the contemporary "age of access"  it is no longer the censors
or the ideologically prejudiced acquisition and cataloging policies of libraries
but rather the copyright restrictions, the market power of individual
companies and the regulation of access that the activists amongst the artists
and poets protest. In this context, Hanna Kuusela and Alessandro
Ludovico are reminded of Aaron Swartz, whose "brave act of freeing the
copyrighted academic knowledge of JSTOR" has been reflected upon
in numerous art projects. As a further example,Eva Weinmayr takes on
Alessandro Ludovico's own hacker project Amazon Noir-The Big Book Crime
that was realized with UBERMORGEN.COM and Paolo Cirio, which utilizes
the "look inside" function of Amazon to acquire complete books from the
online seller's website by using a "robot-perversion-technology" and to then
distribute them across a variety of channels. Nick Thurston expresses his
anxiety about the contemporary surveillance technologies, which practically
disintegrate the difference between writing on a computer and making
something public since everything can immediately be edited and read by
others without the writer ever knowing the better. It is not a stretch, then,
to make the prognosis that the problems of availability, access, and control will
remain dominating themes in society and in the artistic publishing scene
in the coming years.
