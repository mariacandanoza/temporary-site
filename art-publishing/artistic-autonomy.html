Artistic-Autonomy, or: Publishing as Maker Culture

<br><br>
Like in the avant-garde's book art and the artist's book movement of the
1960s and 70s (Anne Mreglin-Delcroix), the idea of artistic freedom
and autonomy is of prime importance to the contemporary artistic publishing
scene. This is concerned less with being independent from institutions,
commerce, and the market than it is with structuring the publishing process
and its framing conditions as well as with expanding the exceptionally
large artistic spectrum for creative leeway regarding content, design,
material, and printing techniques of the publications-whether they are
low-tech, DIY, hand-pressed prints, bulk print runs, POD products, or digital
publications. The active engagement especially of the visual arts with
regards to the making of books is encouraged, indeed, incited by the fact that
"publishing is and always has been a 'maker culture"' that looks back on
a "long craft tradition of printers and publishers."45 As such, it answers the
"longing for the 'humanization of digital technologies"' and the "increasing
ennoblement of the thing in art, theory, and everyday life" that, according to
Hannes Bajohr, are characteristic of the post-digital age and its discourse.
<br><br>
This element of artistic autonomy for every essential aspect of
a publication has become increasingly important in the literary context as
well. Authors are progressively no longer satisfied with simply writing
texts and they no longer consider the design of texts and books as a contingent
factor but rather as properties that constitute their work. Contrary to
the traditional conception of a literary work that reduces it to the text-in the
sense of an abstract, linguistic structure-the designing of a text and a
book has become an essential part of the author's creative activity that is as
valuable as the writing itself. Questions of design are thus no longer held
to be the responsibility of the publisher; rather, they are subjected to one's own
authorship. The Polish artist Zenon Fajfer and the literary scholar Katarzyna
Bazarnik have created the neologism "liberature" in order to describe this
"literature in the form of a book." It shifts the emphasis from "litera"
(lat.: letter) to "liber" (lat.: book): "the material book, which can be of any
shape and structure, ceases to be a neutral container for a text, but becomes
an integral component of the literary work.”
<br><br>
This, of course, is not an exclusively contemporary phenomenon.
There have always been literary authors who have pursued a holistic
"liberatic approach," such as Laurence Sterne, Retif de la Bretonne, William
Blake, Raymond Queneau, William H. Gass, B. S. Johnson, and Raymond
Federman. This "type ofliterary artist, who transgresses the border between
writing and designing" can no longer be embedded only in the category .
of experimental authors. As Alexander Starre illustrates in his contribution,
they can increasingly be found even in "mainstream" trade publishing. The
books of Mark z. Danielewski, who tells his stories not only in a book but
with the book, for instance, are the "collaborative product of a bibliographic
[i.e.: liberatic] author and a design-oriented trade book publisher.”
