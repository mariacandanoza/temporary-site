<br><br>
Radical Contemporaneity

<br><br>

The field of publishing as artistic practice is bound to the moment of its
emergence and stands out for its extreme contemporaneity: it is part of
a continuously changing media landscape that is shaped by economic and
institutional upheavals, discursive shifts in legal, political, and artistic fields
as well as renegotiations of concepts of authorship, creativity, the public
sphere, and accessibility. Not only does publishing stand at the intersection of these developments but it is actively introducing new ruptures-but no
more so than in publishing as artistic practice whose defined sensibility
and delight in experimentation in all realms of publishing incite and inspire
the registration of slightest tensions and quakes, the diagnosis of subtle
dislocations, the critical reflection on both the status quo and emerging
developments, and the probing of new potentials in the field of publishing.
It is still unforeseeable whether the ideas and concepts emerging in the
context of publishing as artistic practice will.have a "Duchamp-like" impact
later-but at least something is happening that is steeped in a grand cultural
tradition and that is concurrently challenging this tradition, promising
openness and open spaces, new beginnings and deeper insights. In the end,
the concepts and projects of publishing as artistic practice build on and
develop publishing culture as well as perform a form of artistic research that
can also be highly beneficial for science and society as well as for the publishing,
literary, and art world.
