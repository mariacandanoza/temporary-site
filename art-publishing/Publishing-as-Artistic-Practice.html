Publishing as Artistic Practice:  The Strictly Artistic Challenge

<br><br>
To conclude, we must come at last to the crucial question, which was implicitly
assumed to have been resolved, though it is not self-evident. In what sense
can we speak of publishing as an artistic practice? What is the actual significance
of an artist turning to publishing, if this significance is not expressed
solely by the social or professional identity of the person who undertakes this
project? How to move beyond the incantatory repetition, rarely justified,
especially among the younger generation, that "publishing is an artistic practice?”

<br><br>
The artist's edition is an artistic practice only if it is deliberately involved
in an overall art project that encompasses publishing among other activities.
That is why, for example, Hansjorg Mayer, although being an artist
and a publisher, is not considered an "artist publisher" strictly speaking because
his publishing work is separate from his art work, even though he has
published artists whose work he came across when he was a concrete poet,
then a filmmaker and a photographer. Publishing only acquires an artistic
significance in relation to the guiding purpose that confers its coherence on a
whole artistic process, however composite its manifestations. In other words,
it does not suffice to say, as we did at the beginning, that art in the sixties and
seventies became a completely open multipurpose activity, which could even
include publishing among other "activities" (to borrow from Allan Kaprow
this word deliberately as broad and commonplace as possible). If we left it at
that, we would simply have to conclude that, faced with the same context,
artists respond to it in similar ways-which can be sociologically true but is
aesthetically false: there is a strong visual identity in all that comes out from
each artist's press, just as there is a strong visual identity in the other manifestations of each one's work (poetry, objects, environments, actions, etc.).
And it is this that is artistically relevant.

<br><br>
So if it is true that in the 1960s-70s, publishing was part of the extension
of an artistic activity whose apparent unity had been fragmented, to
interpret the properly artistic meaning of the work of each artist one has to
seek that unity on another level, both deeper and more personal. It has to be
found in the guiding idea, whether explicit or not, which urged a given artist
to take on this fragmentation in a singular way. In other words, it has to be
found in what might be called the artist's Kunstwollen ("artistic will" or "artistic
volition," depending on how one chooses to translate it). Borrowing this
concept from Alois Riegl, and commenting on it in a famous 1920 text,
Panofsky emphasized its theoretical usefulness. It enables one not to stop at
an explanation of art by its external determinations (in our case the historical
conditions of the redefinition of art and the artist in the 1960s-70s, the nature
of the various activities that it entailed, the expansion of the "small press,"
and other contextual factors that allowed all that). Conversely it helps us characterize
the unity of the "artistic volition" that organizes art from within, in
both form and content, and does so in different ways for each artist. In a given
historical situation that influenced them all simultaneously, each made an
idiosyncratic response, which is why their works differ. To this degree, publishing
is always "a conceptual art project," to quote the formula proposed by
Leif Eriksson in order to define the relation between his publishing work and
his work as a visual artist. "With my press I wanted to do something completely
different from what I had been doing, like graphic prints and traditional
visual art. The publishing press as a conceptual art project." What
does the phrase "a conceptual art project" mean here? Not just a more conceptual
aspect of the work, let alone a kind of printed Conceptual art, but an intellectual
project that is expressed through this channel, among others which all
together make up the whole, more or less homogeneous (in this case rather
heterogeneous), which is identified as the work of this or that person, in the
fullest sense of the term.

<br><br>
The methodological consequence to be drawn from this is as follows.
To carry out a study not of the phenomenon of artists' presses
in general, but the unique way each artist takes part in it by
establishing a style, a style of publications visually and intellectually
identifiable as is the rest of his work, the right approach
would be not to treat the question of publishing
separately, but to consider it from the perspective of all the
artwork by the artist in question, of which it is but a part.
Otherwise publishing is not an artistic practice, just the occupation
of an artist (or of anyone else).
