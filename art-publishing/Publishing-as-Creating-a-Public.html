Publishing as Creating a Public and/or Forming a Community

<br><br>
Although the "printed word" has become "the core of the modern public
sphere" and some form of the public sphere is already included in printing
due to the nature of the medium, the concept of the public sphere remains
highly problematic in its connection to publishing. On the one hand, the
public sphere in general is "a remarkably flabby historical concept" that is,
in addition to this, normatively charged as a concept of democratic theory.
On the other hand, there is no consensus as to whether this is even a sensible
criteria for defining publishing. Nor has it been definitively decided as
to what "to make/ to be public" should mean in this context: Is the principal
notion of the public sphere that is associated with publishing decisive or
does it merely depend on the actual number of copies printed? Is it crucial
that the publication is in principle accessible to everyone or just that it,
in some form, circulates? " [O]r is it epistemological, the state of being
known, or even being known to have been published?"  Whether the public
sphere that the publication is intended for already exists or whether the
publication creates it is another question that could be raised.

<br><br>
In the discourse surrounding publishing as artistic practice, the
tendency has been to adopt the latter position, or at least to make an explicit
differentiation between "making public" and "making a public." In his
attempt to distinguish posting from publishing, Paul Soulellis has defined
them as such: "Posting is usually 'making public,' but publishing is making
'a public' by creating a space for the circulation of discourse." Matthew
Stadler from Publishing Studio supports this when he suggests that publishing
is "not just the production of books, but the production of a public.
This public[ ... ] is created through physical production, digital circulation,
and social gathering. Together these construct a space of conversation
which beckons a public into being." It is noticeable that the first statement
suggests a public being created for the circulation of discourse while the
second is more concerned with a public being created by publication. This,
however, is not necessarily a contradiction. Publication is governed by a
dual movement or circuit, something which squares with Bhaskar's observation
that "growing from a society is only one part of a loop, which also
includes how publishing helps produce societies."

<br><br>
Due to the complexity of the related questions and the shaky concept
of the public sphere, this "social nexus" is often bracketed out of academic
discourse83 although it plays a central role in the discussions concerning
publishing as artistic practice. Very frequently, the idea of making a public
through publishing is connected with the concept of a scene or community
that is conceived of as a limited, yet in principle accessible, open public
sphere. As a rationale for his artistic research with NO-ISBN publications,
Bernhard Cella, for instance, holds that "[w]ithin communities, creating
and stabilizing a collective identity is one of the main reasons for publishing."
Eva Weinmayr affirms this strong connection and has headed
her artistic practice with a quotation by Andre Breton: "One publishes to
find comrades. "

<br><br>
The idea of publishing as a collective, community forming, or
strengthening process affects the publication's production phase as much as
its reception. Based on the awareness that publishing necessarily constitutes
a "concerted speech act" that includes a number of agents, a model for
a publishing community can be developed where a publication is produced
in an act of collective productivity and creativity. One expression of this is the
typical organization and self-portrayal of contemporary publishing houses
and projects as production collectives. Hannes Bajohr has given a depiction
of this with the examples of the "publishing collective" Troll Thread as
well as his own "text collective" OxOa. The community shaping aspect
of publishing also applies to the processes and practice of post-production.
Special modes of circulation have been developed as a means to create community. The practice of bookswapping that Michalis Pichler describes
as well as the social library initiatives and sharing platform projects that
Alessandro Ludovico and Eva Weinmayr discuss are two examples.

<br><br>
The places where the communities can organize, network, exchange,
consolidate, and develop are of increasing importance. These could be
the rooms of production, as is the case in the print stores of Publication Studio,
the rooms of trade, like the currently mushrooming micro fairs (Bernhard
Cella and Michalis Pichler), but also the rooms of reception, like Wendy's
Subway, which is a library, reading room, and workspace, which cultivates
a "social relationship of reading." The ability of this space to facilitate
community and discourse is documented by Rachel Valinsky, K. Antranik
Cassem, and Matt Longabucco in their contribution, in which they take
the opportunity to collectively write a text. In this sense, their tri-vocal contribution
reflects upon and puts to the test "publishing's sociality as a form
of artistic practice."
