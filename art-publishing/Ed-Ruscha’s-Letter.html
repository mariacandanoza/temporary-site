Ed Ruscha’s Letter - An Alternative Information Service - There is No Such Thing as Neutral Knowledge

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: Why start with Ed Ruscha's Twentysix Gasoline Stations?

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: Simply, because he is the pioneer of artists' books and because he gives interesting insights on the topic in a letter we have in The Piracy Collection in London.1 In it, he writes that it was "a terrible mistake" to number the first edition of Twentysix Gasoline Stations. He saw, that numbering the individual copies creates a "limited edition" rather than "just another book." He wanted his books to circulate freely. So it seemed quite counterproductive to turn the book into a collectible. Numbering creates a scarcity that hikes up the value. He actually was right: a copy of the first (numbered) edition of Twentysix Gasoline Stations sells today on Abe Books for 17,432£ [fig. 1]. It has become an object of desire for private collectors and big art institutions likewise.

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: Remind me, what was Ruscha's initial print run?

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: He numbered and signed the first run of 400 in 1963. This had been followed up by a second edition ofS00 in 1967. In 1969, he printed a third edition of 3,000. A huge print run for an artist-booklet. In my view it can be seen as the attempt to flood the market in order to undermine the trading of the books as expensive collectibles.

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: But what's wrong with that? Why can't books primarily be a collector's spoil and reading matter only as a secondary function?

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: Books need to circulate to have an impact by being read: That is why books came about in the first place. Owning a book is fine but it still needs to be accessible. It's quite interesting that, roughly at the same time in the 1960s, a few hundred miles north of Los Angeles another publishing project took off. Stewart Brand, Lois Jennings, and a group of friends kicked around ideas to finally set up a serial publication in 1968: the Whole Earth Catalog-an alternative information service and distribution system [fig. 2].

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: I guess it was more about providing information to friends, who like themselves, attempted to live in communes. It was more a newsletter than a real book.

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: The decisive point is that its publication gave it freedom to
circulate. It was published twice a year-with more frequent updates
in the form of supplements. The Whole Earth Catalog collated reviews of self-published counterculture literature, manuals, information about new tools,building and land use designs, as well as general philosophical texts. It provided practical "News to Use" for everybody in the community and source ideas for potential community building. Imagine the perversity, had such a rich tool been put into the cupboard of a solvent collector. David Senior, bibliographer at the MoMA Library, wrote a fantastic text about it in Fragments from Access to Tools: Publications from the Whole Earth Catalog
1968-1974 [fig. 3).

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: If l am correctly informed, it also listed and reviewed a wide range of products such as books, manuals, tools, machines, but did not sell any of the products directly. Instead, the vendor's contact information was listed alongside the item and its review. In that it was decidedly anti-commercial.

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: No doubt. And in a way it resembled an alternative library project-a kind of "reading list for a coming community,"2 as Senior put it. And as such the Whole Earth Catalog was not just informing about tools, it was a tool in itself, a publishing concept and a community-in-print. It was also a kind of educational service. Before they started the magazine, Stewart and his wife Lois embarked on a commune road trip with a truck touring the country and doing educational fairs. The Whole Earth Truck Store was not only "a store, but also an alternative lending library and a mobile microeducation fair." 3
INNER VOICE: Interestingly, David Senior describes the catalog project as a precursor of today's online communities as the publication talked directly to its readership, asked its readers questions and completed the feedback loop by publishing reader letters, reviews and announcements.

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR:  Yes, and that's why the catalog became very popular and kept growing. In the years 1968 to 1975, more than 2.5 million copies were sold. It was a living organism, alive and kicking, rather than something dead put on a plinth for worship. They were widely distributed through informal channels like mail order, alternative bookshops, and in community libraries.

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: Libraries were an important reference point at the time, as it seems.

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: Indeed, one of the many ads in the Whole Earth Catalog announced the 158-page library press publication Revolting Librarians [fig. 4] which campaigned for the inclusion of neglected topics in their library information service. Materials produced by independent and small-scale publishers had up to then not been reviewed in the library press, therefore not acquired for the libraries. Subsequently, they were not accessible for the readers, who had to do with the fairly limited range of publications by commercial publishing houses. Those, of course, would pick up alternative topics only when profit could be sensed.

<br><br>
Question: Do you know Celeste West?

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: Yes, she is brilliant! She actually co-edited the Revolting Librarians book. She was a feminist librarian and, in 1967, the founding editor of Synergy Magazine, an alternative library newsletter. She campaigned for librarians to become pivotal to enforce the Library Bill of Rights issued by the American Library Association in the 1930s.

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: Free and neutral provision and access to knowledge for everybody is the famous creed of that bill.

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: Neutral? I don't think there is such a thing as neutrality when it comes to knowledge! Librarian activists such as Synergy Magazine demanded to address and recognize the political context of the work of librarians. They looked at the nature of library catalogs, indexes, and search tools because they believed that "these tools were mostly 'rear-view mirrors' that provided little or no bibliographic access to the actual information needs." From April 1968 on, a feature section was included in an attempt "to concentrate on subjects of current interest or on popular subjects for which we feel there is a lack of available information."4 These were subjects such as Women's Liberation, Gay Liberation, Dope, Native Americans, Ecology, Changing the Family Structure, Independent Publishing, and the Underground Press. 5

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: (Holding up a back cover of Synergy Magazine) This list of subjects here gives an instructive overview of topics important to them [fig.5].

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: New cataloging and new subjects were just one thing. Celeste West's aim was also to fundamentally shift the concept of the library from "conserving and organizing information to generating or promoting" it.6 She initiated an alternative library culture that was less preoccupied with archiving of cultural records then more with activating them.

<br><br>
INNER VOICE: It sounds as if you also came across Anna-Sophie Springer's book Fantasies of the Library?

<br><br>
EVA WEINMAYR: Andrea Francke just sent me a copy [fig. 6]. It basically builds on Celeste West. The book looks at libraries from a curatorial perspective. It says that the library's primary function privileges active use over passive display and presentation, whereas museums and archives normally store objects and information only after the time of their utility has expired. So the library is really about being switched on by its readers. And that is a good thing.
