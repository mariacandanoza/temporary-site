<br><br>
The publication is the artwork.

<br><br>
I am attracted to the publication as form (or many forms)
e.g., the sequences of pages, privacy of viewing.

<br><br>
I am attracted to the interconnections surrounding self publishing,
distribution, community, and the many contexts
the publication can find itself in.

<br><br>
I can make something cheaply, distribute it, and move on
to the next idea or publication at speed.
