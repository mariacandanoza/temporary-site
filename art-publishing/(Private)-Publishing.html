(Private) Publishing in a Personal Network of Relationships

<br><br>
One extreme of such community specific publishing takes place when the
intended public is limited to a very small, almost private circle from its
inception. This form of publishing within a limited public sphere that was
familiar in earlier cultures of sociability such as the scholarly circles of the
early modern age or literary circles of friends and literary salons is discussed
in the current volume in conjunction with samizdat publications (Vadim
Zakharov, Valentina Parisi) and NO-ISBN publications(Bernhard
Cella). These publications derive from an environment of intimate communication
that is based on personal acquaintances. Usually passed from hand
to hand, they circulate "outside of the 'anonymous' public sphere, namely
in a restricted circle of tendentially reciprocally communicating 'friends.'"
In this sense, Vadim Zakharov has also explicitly identified the samizdat
publications as "token[s] of friendship" and as a continuation of the typical
studio and kitchen conversations that took place during those years. This.
form of publishing practice that is primarily focused on the human relationships
contains an aspect of authenticity and trust that would be lost in
addressing an anonymous public sphere, which is why Vadim Zakharov
adhered to this format even long after Perestroika.

<br><br>
By embedding production, circulation, and reception in a personal
network of relationships, the publications that appear in a minimal number
of copies-regardless of whether they are circulated as a manuscript,
typescript, private printing, or POD-have the private nature of a manuscript
or letter. This has implications for the status of the work since this is
constrained by the socialization of the text. Following Jerome McGann (see
above), a text becomes a work as a result of its publication. Furthermore, there is also a difference between unprinted, "private" manuscripts and
the "public" printed page with regards to the aesthetic judgment of
the work's status: in contrast to the published text, which is seen as being
complete, a manuscript is considered to be "unfinished," and regarded
as being a mere draft.

<br><br>
This lesser status is mirrored in the general neglect or even contempt
of manuscript books and private printings in the history of literature,
books, and libraries as well as in its special treatment it receives from the
law. The conditions under which a publication has legal implications are not
yet in force with a manuscript. In Germany, for instance, a publication that
is marked with "printed as a manuscript," can rely on the fact that "a publishing
of the work in the sense of a public notification hasn't been achieved,
which is why it is forbidden to cite such a text," or to duplicate, discuss in
a critique, or otherwise make use of it.

<br><br>
Interestingly, the limited medial, legal, and aesthetic status of
such private publications doesn't apply to the samizdat culture. Regardless
of the limited print run and extremely limited circulation, samizdat was
understood by all of its members (as well as by the state) as a publishing
model and their texts were normally granted the status of a publication and
work. As Vadim Zakharov explains, there was an unspoken agreement:
"As soon as we completed the five copies and brought them into circulation,
they were, for us, finished and released, that is, published." Following
Valentina Parisi, one could speak of an "increasing institutionalization of
self-publishing in the 1970s."

<br><br>
The act of circulation is crucial here. As such, this verifies Bhaskar's
thesis that the number of copies published does not determine its public
nature: "Scale, while not irrelevant, neither constitutes nor invalidates
amplification. Amplification has various degrees and criteria for success,
dependent on the model being used. At a conceptual extreme, the idea
of amplification says that even if only one more copy is encountered than
otherwise, then we have amplification; we have publishing."

<br><br>
That the samizdat transcripts were associated with a definite
status of publication is also reflected in Valentina Parisi's findings that
a surprising number of writers sought to give their hand or typewritten
products the appearance of being a book by making them look like printed
matter, especially by using typical paratextual elements such as a title
page, publisher logo, and imprint. This was done also by faithfully imitating
the text's setting and typography. Valentina Parisi classifies this "kind
of mimicry" as "samizdat reprints."

<br><br>
It is equally astonishing that "a samizdat copyright" has emerged
that prohibits the reproduction of the samizdat editions without the author's
consent. Claiming the copyright for a work aims at strengthening the position
of the author and wielding a form of work authority especially in anonymous
communication situations where the author loses the direct control over
his work, as in the case of print publications, which address a wider audience
that is not personally known by the author. There is, therefore, every
indication that these copyrighted samizdat editions-even if only a handful
of copies exists-are no longer conceived of as manuscripts but as released
works in a greater, rather anonymous public sphere.

<br><br>
Samizdat thereby established an unusual "forum for communication,
which is situated on the threshold between the public and private
sphere" that could potentially be taken as a role model for contemporary
digital constellations that also cannot be "adequately conceived through the
strict dichotomy of private and public communication." In this sense,
the NO-ISBN scene that Bernhard Cella examines oscillates between the
private aspect of communication and the desire to enter the public sphere
as well. One sometimes has the impression that the status of the publication
is purposely left in limbo. Every now and again, the NO-ISBN publications
seem to have arisen less from the wish of"creating a public" than from the
interest in publishing as a "maker culture." As such, it is in accordance
with the general trend of handmade products that has emerged in our society.
